                <p>What is it that makes the very heart leap within you at the sight of a 
                    hill&#x02BC;s blue outline; that so &#x00E6;therializes the soul and ennobles the spirit; 
                    that so raises you from the earth and from aught of the earth? Is it 
                    their apparent proximity to the blue heaven&#x02BC;s inaccessibleness? is it the 
                    humbling sense of your own littleness or the immoveable, unchangeable 
                    magnificence of that which has seen the beginning of the world and will see<pb/>
                    its end, or is it that the thoughts range insensibly from the things created 
                    to Him who created them? I know not. How it thrilled through me, 
                    when first, far away, across the lake&#x2010;like swell of the deep waters of that 
                    wondrous river, rose the cloudy outline of the blue mountains. Long time 
                    hath past over me since I saw the swell of a blue hill. I have longed for 
                    them&#x2014;I have yearned for them as an exile yearns for his native land, and 
                    I am with them.</p>
                <p>We left <placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName> on a misty summer morning, its many turreted spires 
                    rising colossally, but grey and faint amid the wreathing columns of mist, 
                    which smoked upward from the course of the broad <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>. There was 
                    the huge cathedral, dark with the confused richness of its own fretwork, 
                    and the remains of its unfinished but magnificent tower showing ruin&#x2010;like 
                    beside it.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="andernacht_glosses.php#ANDERNACHTCATHEDRALTOWERGLOSS"/> There were the red sails and mingled masts of the innumerable 
                    shipping, without one sail swelling or a flag bending with the morning 
                    breeze. There was that peaceful and lovely lassitude over everything, that 
                    sleep of the earth, and the air, and the sky, that charms the mind into a 
                    correspondent fascination of stillness, the very thoughts seem sleeping.</p>
                <p>We went on, we past <placeName corresp="#BONN">Bonn</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#GODESBERG">Godesberg</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#DRACHENFELS">Drachenfels</placeName>,<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="andernacht_glosses.php#ANDERNACHTWEWENTONGLOSS"/> and 
                    sunset was sorrowing over hill and valley when the gloomy and venerable 
                    towers of <placeName corresp="#ANDERNACH">Andernacht</placeName> beetled over us.</p>
                <p>I love to look upon the crags that C&#x00E6;sar has scaled, and upon the 
                    towers that his legions have founded. These are now as they were then, 
                    looking up to the broad blue heaven, these are in ruins.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="andernacht_glosses.php#ANDERNACHTTHESEGLOSS"/> Yet they 
                    are mighty in their ruin, and majestic in their decay, but their Lords are 
                    departed and forgotten as the waves that once lashed their foundations. 
                    Other snows have melted, and the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> yet rolls onward unbroken, but 
                    those waves are lost in the ocean for ever.</p>
