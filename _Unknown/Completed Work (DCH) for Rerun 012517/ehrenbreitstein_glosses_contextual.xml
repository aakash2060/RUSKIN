                    the hill of <geogName corresp="#EHRENBREITSTEIN">Ehrenbreitstein</geogName>, fortifications of the same name had been erected from Roman through medieval times. In <date when ="1833">1833</date>, 
                    scarce any vestige remained of the ancient architecture, the fortress having been destroyed by French troops in <date when="1801">1801</date> and rebuilt by <placeName corresp="#PRUSSIA">Prussia</placeName> after <date when="1815">1815</date>, 
                    as a practical enforcement of its power in <date notBefore="1815">post&#x2010;Napoleonic</date> <placeName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</placeName>. Despite the now utilitarian character of the works, 
                    artists and tourists persisted in romanticizing the site (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#TAYLORCASTLES"><persName corresp="#RRT">Taylor</persName>, <title corresp="#TAYLORCASTLES">Castles of the Rhine</title></ref>, 98&#x2013;111). 
                    <persName corresp="#GGB">Lord Byron</persName> helped to popularize the site by commemorating the recent conflict over the fortress in canto 3 (<date when="1816">1816</date>), 
                    stanza 58, of <title type="poem" corresp="#BYRONPILGRIMAGE"><hi rend="italic">Childe Harold&#x02BC;s Pilgrimage</hi></title>

                    Writing in mid&#x2010;1830s, the English artist and teacher, <persName corresp="#JML">James Mathews Leigh</persName> (<date notBefore="1808" notAfter="1860">1808&#x2013;60</date>), 
                    admitted no illusions about the regrettable loss of the antique ruins, but could still perceive the artistic appeal of the site: 
                    &#x201C;The whole surface of the rock glowed with the richest hues of sunset; its naturally deep&#x2010;toned and richly&#x2010;coloured form assuming an endless diversity of tints, 
                    combined into a focus of harmonious light, and relieved by the broad shadows of the surrounding objects. A multitude of beautiful parts subdued to a general breadth of effect 
                    will be the description best understood by the learned in art. . . . Beautiful as it is, crowned by the pride of modern masonry, and the intricate contrivances of modern engineering, 
                    it possessed far more romantic beauty in the former dismantled state of the shattered fortress bearing the picturesque traces of ruthless violence&#x201D;

                    peculiar to the poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JREHRENBREITSTEIN">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D;</title>, lines 35&#x2013;38 introduced changes in the 
                    <date when="1850">1850</date> text, but the revision is based on a version of these lines as they had been altered using deletion and addition in the 
                    <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> draft, alterations that were abandoned for the original version in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> 
                    fair copy. That is, in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> originally composed 
                    &#x201C;The rivers pass full playfully, / . . . / The river tosses by&#x201D;; and in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> he fair&#x2010;copied those lines. 
                    But <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> also shows an alteration of these lines to &#x201C;They pass together playfully / . . . / The torrent tosses by&#x201D;; 
                    and this version is what appears in the <date when="1850">1850</date> and <date when="1903">1903</date> texts. Thus, we have evidence that the compilers of the 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1850_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1850"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1850)</title></ref>, 
                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> and <persName corresp="WHH">W. H. Harrison</persName>, were interested in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    earlier rough drafts of poetry. Alternatively, it is possible that the revisions in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> were not ignored 
                    in <date notBefore="1833" notAfter="1834">1833&#x2013;34</date> when fair&#x2010;copying the <title type="composite" corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, 
                    but rather were made years later, prompted by the editing of the <title type="book" corresp="#JRPOEMS1850"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1850)</title>. 
                    The hand in which the changes are made in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title> does appear to be that of the younger 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, but such small changes allow meager basis for analysis.</p>

                    was described by the artist <persName corresp="#JML">James Mathews Leigh</persName>, writing from <placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName> at about the same time as the Ruskins&#x02BC; journey: 
                    &#x201C;I was . . . startled at the cries which accompanied the apparent destruction of the bridge of boats, fragments of which were floating away 
                    from the main body. . . . A majestic raft of the largest dimensions was floating down the river to its ultimate destination. The measured voices of the innumerable rowers 
                    who laboured at either end of the enormous mass had an imposing effect as they mingled with the splashings of their ample paddles. The <hi rend="italic">deck</hi> was covered with their cabins, 
                    and at different points were elevated stations from which the word of command was given by tongue of trumpet. No notion can be formed of the quantity of timber employed in these rafts 
                    from a sight of their extended forms on the water. . . . [T]here are sometimes from seven to nine hundred workmen and rowers employed. 
                    The largest rafts are generally from seven to nine hundred feet long and seventy broad, and are composed of the produce of <placeName corresp="#SWITZERLAND">Switzerland</placeName>, the <geogName corresp="#BLACKFOREST">Black Forest</geogName>, 
                    and the fir forests of the <geogName corresp="#MURG">Murg</geogName>, which is brought to <placeName corresp="#DORDRECHT">Dordrecht</placeName>, there to be distributed and conveyed to the various foreign and domestic markets. . . . 
                    This striking object passed majestically through the gap in the bridge, and in a very short time the barges were rejoined and the promenaders resumed their stations [on the bridge]&#x201D;
