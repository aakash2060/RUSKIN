                <div type="prose">
                    <p>It is said that French will carry you over all <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName>, over all 
                        civilised <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName> at least, and that may be, but it will not carry you 
                        over <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>. You might manage with the Grand Turk, but you will 
                        not manage with the Germans. Wishing to see the interior of <placeName corresp="#EHRENBREITSTEIN">Ehrenbreitstein</placeName>, 
                        we got a young German guide, and crossing to a place where 
                        two roads met, considered him to be going the wrong way. There was a 
                        poser&#x2014;how could we stop him? &#x201C;Nein, nein,&#x201D; we called after him. &#x201C;Ya,&#x201D; 
                        quoth he. &#x201C;Nein.&#x201D; So he went the way we chose.</p>
                    <p>After a very hard pull up an abominably cramp<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="ehrenbreitstein_glosses.php#EHRENBREITSTEINCRAMPGLOSS"/> hill, we beheld the 
                        top of the flagstaff. Here we are all right. No. There was the 
                        fortress certainly, but between us and it a ravine nearly a hundred feet 
                        deep, walled up the sides so as to form a very unhandsome ditch, and two 
                        or three dozen impudent, enormous, open&#x2010;mouthed guns grinning at us 
                        from the battlement. Well, there was nothing for it, so we went back 
                        and took the other path.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="ehrenbreitstein_glosses.php#EHRENBREITSTEINPATHGLOSS"/></p>
                    <p>This time all went right, and we got into the fortress, first, however, 
                        prudently stepping up to a sentinel, to ask permission: and he brought 
                        an officer upon us. &#x201C;Do you speak English, sir?&#x201D; (A stare.) &#x201C;Fran&#x00E7;ais?&#x201D; 
                        (A vibratory motion of the head, and a &#x201C;Nein.&#x201D;) &#x201C;Deutsch?&#x201D; &#x201C;Ya,&#x201D; and 
                        there we stuck. Well, we pulled out our passport, but it was in French, 
                        and the officer could not read it. So he looked up and down and at us, 
                        and we looked up and down and at him. What was to be done? We 
                        bowed and he bowed, and we looked over the battlements and trotted 
                        down again, having a very high opinion of the height of German hills, 
                        the strength of German walls, the size of German cannon, and the stupidity 
                        of all German brains.</p>
