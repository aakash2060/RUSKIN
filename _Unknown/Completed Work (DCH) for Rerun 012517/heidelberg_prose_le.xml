                <p>Most beautiful are the paths which scale the face of the hill which is 
                    crowned by the <name type="building" corresp="#HEIDELBERGCASTLE">castle of Heidelberg</name>,<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="heidelberg_glosses_contextual.php#BEAUTIFULPATHS"/> winding beneath the twisted branches 
                    of green woods, with here and there a grey crag lifting up its lichened 
                    head from the wilderness of brake<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="heidelberg_glosses_contextual.php#BRAKE"/> and grass and flower that concealed 
                    the mass of that ancient granite, sometimes supporting a fragment of the 
                    remains of the old walls, with here and there an arrow&#x2010;slit choked up with 
                    ivy, then emerging on narrow vallies or steep and rocky dells, or lovely 
                    sweeps of dewy green sward, fresh and flowery as ever fairies circled on, 
                    and ending on a lofty terrace whose precipice&#x2010;base was begirt with 
                    meadow land, at the point where a narrow mountain gorge opened into 
                    the mighty plains of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName>, having in its embouchure<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="heidelberg_glosses_contextual.php#EMBOUCHURE"/> the little town 
                    of <placeName corresp="#HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</placeName>, with its river and its tall arched bridge, all glistening under 
                    that most lovely of all lights,&#x2014;the first glow of sunshine, after a spring 
                    shower.</p> 
                
                <p>The <placeName type="building" corresp="#HEIDELBERG">castle of Heidelberg</placeName> is exceeding desolate. Armies have razed 
                    its foundations, the thunder hath riven its towers, and there is no sound 
                    in its courts, and the wind is still in the open galleries.<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="heidelberg_glosses_contextual.php#DESOLATE"/> The grass is very 
                    green on the floor of the hall of the banquet, and the wild birds build 
                    their nests in the watch&#x2010;towers, and they dwell in the dwellings of man, 
                    for they are forsaken and left, and there is no voice there&#x2014;there is no 
                    complaining in the dungeon, and where is the voice of gladness in the 
                    hall? It is a ruin, a ruin, a desolate ruin. The husbandman sees it on 
                    the height of the hills as he looks up from the green valley, and remembers 
                    the power of his ancient princes, and knows not if he should grieve that 
                    their power is past away. I know not how it is, but all nations in all 
                    ages seem to have respected the juice of the fruit of the vine. All has 
                    yielded to it from time immemorial. When Marshal Turenne attacked the 
                    castle in question,<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="heidelberg_glosses_contextual.php#TURENNE"/> it was but a touch and go. The foundations were 
                    blown up, the battlements were knocked down, the towers snapt like so 
                    many sticks of barley sugar, the statues decapitated, the carving crashed, 
                    the ditches filled, the castle ruined, but the cellars&#x2014; Walk into them, sir, 
                    walk into them; there is not a rat dispossessed or in any manner disturbed. 
                    Why, they seem to have stopped puffing off powder here as if they were 
                    afraid of shaking up the lees of the good old respectable wines. Even 
                    the timber of the new&#x2010;fangled fashionable cask (which, following the 
                    example of the ladies nowadays, has gone without hoops) are not a whit 
                    disturbed, but sit there in peaceful placidity, clasping each other in 
                    brotherly affection, but dry, very dry, unconscionably dry. And the celebrated 
                    butt sounds mournfully hollow&#x2014;<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="heidelberg_glosses_contextual.php#CELEBRATEDBUTT"/> no rich splash from the enclosed 
                    <hi rend="italic">vinum</hi>,<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="heidelberg_glosses_contextual.php#VINUM"/> no ruby red tinging the joints of the timbers. Oh, <name type="fictional" corresp="#BACCHUS">Bacchus</name>! 
                    <name type="fictional" corresp="#BACCHUS">Bacchus</name>! come not into the cellars of <placeName type="building" corresp="#HEIDELBERG">Heidelberg</placeName>, lest thou shouldest die 
                    of thirst.</p>
