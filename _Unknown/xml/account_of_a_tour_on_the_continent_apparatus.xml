                    <p>In <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</ref>, 
                        <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> printed the title, 
                        Account of a Tour on the Continent, without square brackets, his symbol for declaring editorial intervention. 
                        Nonetheless, the title apparently originated with him, as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> assigned no title to the 
                        sequence as a whole in any of the extant manuscripts 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1: 119, 281;

                        What titles <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> supplied apply only to individual verse 
                        and prose sections of the work. Accordingly, in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, 
                        when the main title is fully spelled out, it is given without quotation 
                        marks, in keeping with the guidelines given in <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="title_citation_note.php">The System of Title Citation for Works</ref>. 
                        In this apparatus, however, for convenience in the course of discussion, a short title is used with quotation marks (i.e., the &#x0201C;Account&#x0201D;) 
                        in order to avoid confusion with surrounding text.</p>
                    <p>In another, more minor discrepancy respecting the editorial title, both

                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php">Library Edition</ref> cite the title in their respective tables of contents as 
                        &#x201C;Account of a Tour on the Continent in <date when="1833">1833</date>,&#x201D; but the title pages of the work in these editions lack

                    <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> also invented titles for some individual sections of verse, untitled sections that he took from 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s

                    <p>Composite verse and prose illustrated travelogue. As proposed in 
                        <ref type="internal" target="COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName> may originally have conceived the genre 
                        of the work as a travelogue solely in verse&#x2014;a version represented by a manuscript now bound in <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php">MS IA</ref>, 
                        and designated in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> as

                        The work returned to this characterization as an all&#x2010;verse travelogue, when selections were excerpted and revised under the title, 
                        <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</ref> 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#TITLE">Title</ref>). By this time, however, the scenario of a 
                        &#x201C;Metrical Journal&#x201D; was imaginary, since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had developed the work into a composite 
                        genre that included prose and graphic elements, as well as poetry, in its <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX version</ref>.</p>

                    <p><ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php">MS IA</ref> contains two distinct manuscripts related to the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; 
                        designated in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> as 
                        <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</ref>, and

                        When <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> was preparing 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</ref>, 
                        he was apparently aware of both of these manuscripts, although they had not yet been bound in <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php">MS IA</ref>. 
                        Among manuscripts currently extant, <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g2.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</ref>, 
                        is the only known source of two poems, <ref type="witness" target="passing_the_alps_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Passing the Alps&#x201D;</ref> 
                        and <ref type="witness" target="milan_cathedral_poem_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Milan Cathedral&#x201D;</ref>, and <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> 
                        includes both of these poems in his version of the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; 
                        His aquaintance with <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</ref> is equally probable, 
                        since he draws on what he calls the &#x201C;original&#x201D; draft of the poem, &#x201C;Calais,&#x201D; 
                        selecting lines that exist only in this version (see <ref type="gloss_contextual" target="calais_poem_glosses.php#CALAISPOEMLINE2">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem], gloss to line 2</ref>).</p>
                    <p><persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> is inconsistent and seemingly arbitrary in 
                        his reliance on these &#x201C;originals,&#x201D; however. 
                        When printing what he calls the &#x201C;original draft&#x201D; of the poem &#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D; and the &#x201C;first draft&#x201D; of the poem &#x201C;St. Goar,&#x201D; 
                        his choice among variants shows that he adopted copytext from 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s fair copies in <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX</ref>&#x2014;and 
                        not from these poems&#x02BC; earliest extant drafts, found in

                        Likewise inconsistent in his approach to <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</ref>, 
                        he chooses arbitrarily between lines of <ref type="witness" target="calais_poem_msia_g1.php">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</ref> as originally composed in the hand of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>

                    <p>The miscellaneous contents of <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php">MS IA</ref> were collected and bound 
                        under the auspices of the editors of the

                        (see <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php#PROVENANCE">MS IA: Provenance</ref>). 
                        <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> made greater use of these earlier versions of the "Account" than did <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>. 
                        In their editing of <ref type="witness" target="calais_poem_msia_g1.php">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</ref>, they 
                        refer to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;father&#x02BC;s copy&#x201D; 
                        of this poem, ascribing the text to <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</ref>; 
                        and they ascribe their copytext of <ref type="witness" target="st_goar_poem_msia.php">&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D;</ref> 
                        to the manuscript <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g2.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</ref>. 
                        This suggests, incidentally, that

                        <p>None of the manuscripts is dated by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>. Presumably, 
                            he began the work no earlier than the family&#x02BC;s departure for the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> shortly after

                            birthday, and it is possible that he began it no earlier than following 
                            their return home in <date notBefore="1833-09-20" notAfter="1833-09-30">late September 1833</date>. 
                            Neither of these possible termini a quo can be ruled out by the physical evidence of what is likely the earliest extant manuscript, 
                            <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</ref>. 
                            This manuscript, which is in the hands of both father and son, 
                            could even have been begun during the journey itself (see <ref type="internal" target="COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>).</p>
                        <p>If one argues a terminus a quo for <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</ref>, 
                            as the return home to <placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>, that date would be after 
                            <date notBefore="1833-09-19">19 September 1833</date>, which was the day that the
                            family reached <placeName corresp="#BOULOGNE">Boulogne</placeName>,
                            according to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s travel
                            diary (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS33A">Diary of John James Ruskin, 1833&#x2013;46</ref>, p. 74). 
                            A few more days would have been required in order to transact 
                            business and cross the <geogName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</geogName> at 
                            <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName>.</p>
                        <p>It is likely that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> carried out 
                            the bulk of the composition and fair copying (especially the composite 
                            genre version) between <date when="1833-10">October 1833</date> and 
                            <date when="1834-08">August 1834</date>, the latest date when he could have delivered his contribution,

                            It is possible and even likely that, in order to devote his attention to these exciting commissions, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> ceased steady work on his 
                            <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair copy</ref> of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; 
                            some months earlier than the <date when="1834-08">August</date> deadline&#x2014;perhaps abandoning the fair copy in

                        <p>Strong evidence in <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.php">MS VIII</ref> shows that 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> labored on both draft and fair copy of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; in <date when="1834">1834</date>, 
                            through the period when he normally prepared anniversary poetry for his father&#x02BC;s May birthday&#x2014;the poems, namely,

                            Some very tenuous evidence exists that he extended work on the project until much later into the year, past <date when="1834-08">September 1834</date>: 
                            in the prose section of <ref type="witness" target="brussels_prose_msix.php">&#x201C;Brussels</ref>&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s
                            description of a distant view of the city resembles features in an engraved view of the subject 
                            based on a drawing by <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>, an engraving that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could not have seen prior to its publication 
                            in <date when="1834-09">September 1834</date> (see the gloss on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s description of the cathedral towers in

                            However, the similarity of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            and <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s prospects could be coincidental, 
                            whereas the evidence for dating the draft of the prose section of <ref type="witness" target="brussels_prose_msix.php">&#x201C;Brussels</ref>&#x201D;,
                            which is included in <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php">MS VIII</ref>, 
                            weighs heavily in favor of a date between <date when="1834-02">February</date> through <date when="1834-05">May 1834</date>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> probably started this <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php">MS VIII draft</ref> 
                            for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;&#x2014;draft consisting largely of poems relating to the Alpine and Italian stages of the tour, 
                            along with prose relating to the Belgian and German stages&#x2014;around the time of his <date when="1834-02-08">8 February 1834 birthday</date>.  
                            This important stint of draft can therefore be dated approximately between 
                            <date when="1834-02-08">8 February</date> and <date when="1834-05-10">10 May</date>. 
                            The stint terminates with draft of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s ekphrastic and topographical poem, 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="saltzburg_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</ref>, which was commissioned for

                            According to <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName>, the latter poem dates from <date when="1835">1835</date>, 
                            so that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> must have inserted its draft later on a blank page following the <date when="1834">1834</date> sequence; 
                            however, in <ref type="internal" target="COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>, it is argued that the draft 
                            of <ref type="apparatus" target="saltzburg_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</ref> 
                            falls in a logical place in <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.php">MS VIII</ref>, as belonging to <date when="1834">1834</date>. 
                            Its placement at the point where the  
                            <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php">MS VIII &#x201C;Account&#x201D; draft</ref> abruptly ends suggests that the commission of

                            No available evidence explains the timing of this commission relative to that for <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</ref> in the same volume

                            The Ruskins did bring home <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s book in <date when="1833-04">April 1833</date>, but it is absurd to imagine that it 
                            sponsored <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s suggestion that the family &#x201C;should . . . go and see some of [the wonderful places] in reality,&#x201D; 
                            and that forthwith &#x201C;there were two or three weeks of entirely rapturous and amazed preparation&#x201D; for such a journey. 
                            As <persName corresp="#JDHUNT">John Dixon Hunt</persName> points out, a letter by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            from <date when="1831-03-21">21 March 1831</date> indicates that the Ruskins had been planning their 
                            &#x201C;Switzerlandish outlandish tour to <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>&#x201D; for at least two years 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35: 79;

                        <p>The more elusive date is when the Ruskins acquired the <date when="1830">1830</date> edition of 
                            <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>. The question is of some interest, since it is argued in <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref> 
                            that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Account&#x201D; underwent a development similar to that of 
                            <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>&#x2014;evolving from an all&#x2010;verse to a composite&#x2010;genre work. 
                            Unfortunately, the evidence is too contradictory to be able to align the family&#x02BC;s acquisition of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            <date when="1830">1830</date> illustrated edition with 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s reworking of the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; In the autobiography, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself admits that he has 
                            &#x201C;told this story so often&#x201D; about the influence of <persName corresp="#SR">Roger</persName>&#x02BC;s illustrated edition 
                            and its revelation of <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s art, &#x201C;that I begin to doubt its time.&#x201D; 
                            In <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>&#x02BC;s typically dramatizing fashion, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> declares that 
                            &#x201C;the main tenor of my life&#x201D; was set on <date when="1832-02-08">8 February 1832</date> by the birthday gift from his father&#x02BC;s business partner, 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="telford_henry_note.php">Henry Telford (d. 1859)</ref>. 
                            &#x201C;It is curiously tiresome that Mr. <persName corresp="#HT">Telford</persName> did not himself write my name in the book, 
                            and my father, who writes in it, &#x2018;The gift of <persName corresp="#HT">Henry Telford</persName>, Esq.,&#x2019;  
                            still more curiously, for him, puts no date: if it was a year later [i.e., <date when="1833-02-08">8 February 1833</date>], no matter&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35: 79). 
                            In fact, the possible range is even wider. 
                            In a non&#x2010;illustrated edition, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poem had been in the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> household 
                            since <date when="1828">1828</date> at the latest 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 188 n. 4).
                            This happens to be the year when <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> published &#x201C;Part the Second&#x201D; of the poem; 
                            and growing disgusted over the work&#x02BC;s tepid reception, he bought out remaining copies of both that volume and &#x201C;Part the First,&#x201D; and destroyed them 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROGERSITALY1828">Rogers, <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> (1828)</ref>; 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROGERSITALY1823">Rogers, <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> (1823)</ref>; 
                            and see <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="samuel_rogers_note.php">Samuel Rogers [1763&#x2013;1855]</ref>). 
                            Thus, even before <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poem achieved popularity in the illustrated edition, 
                            the Ruskins could count themselves among the select number of appreciative readers of the work in its original form, 
                            and it is possible that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and <persName corresp="#JJR">his father</persName> 
                            projected a work on this unillustrated verse model prior to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s receiving the gift of the illustrated version.</p>
                        <p>When, then, did <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first see the <date when="1830">1830</date> version? 
                            It is possible that the gift did spur the family&#x02BC;s travel plans, but earlier than <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> remembered, 
                            since the first mention of Continental tour occurs in the letters the family letters for <date when="1831">1831</date>. 
                            His <date when="1831-02-08">1831 birthday</date> predates that first mention by only a month. 
                            An alternative, surprising possibility is that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> owned the illustrated edition only after 
                            the family had returned from the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName>. According to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s accounts, 
                            he purchased a copy of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> 
                            in <date when="1833-10">October 1833</date>, just shortly after the <date when="1833-09">September</date> homecoming 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 286 n. 1).
                            Could this explain why <persName corresp="#HT">Telford</persName>&#x02BC;s dedication is in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand? 
                            This <date when="1833-10">October 1833</date> purchase could well have been an additional copy of the <date when="1830">1830</date> version 
                            that was already well loved by the family, 
                            and it seems unlikely that the Ruskins would have acquired this popular book so belatedly. Nonetheless, 
                            one cannot discount the possibility that <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s tutelage of the Ruskins&#x02BC; 
                            viewing of the <placeName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName> was, during the tour itself, solely poetic 
                            and based on earlier versions of the poem, 
                            whereas the ekphrastic influence of <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName> and <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName> 
                            enhanced <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s perception at almost precisely the time when he developed an illustrated version of his own.</p>

                                collaborated on an all&#x2010;verse version of the travelogue, relating the family&#x02BC;s initial stage of their journey,

                                <ref type="apparatus" target="msix_apparatus.php">MS IX</ref>. This draft relates mainly to the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</geogName> journey, 
                                the sighting and crossing of the <geogName corresp="#ALPS">Alps</geogName>, the tour in northern <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>,

                                to continue his draft (probably around the start of <date when="1834-02">February 1834</date>), 
                                he was catching up with composition of prose sections to match with poetry about places in <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>

                                who specialized in on&#x2010;demand travel writing, regardless of whether these writers had personally visited the places they described

                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> organized the fair copy as composite groups,

                                In the drawings, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> either exactingly copied or imitated and adapted the manner of work by topographical and figure illustrators,

                                Several of these proposed additions are represented by poetry or prose

                                Draft writing and drawings for this proposed extension of the fair copy may have been lost, but much of the ambitious plan probably was never executed. 
                                A few other fugitive pieces of writing, probably intended for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; and fair&#x2010;copied in hands other than <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s,

                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> perhaps began compiling his list of proposed contents in <date notBefore="1834-03-01" notAfter="1834-04-30">March or April 1834</date>.

                                However, as indicated by a list for projected development of the project,

                                the editors may have meant to repair a rift caused by the omission of this poem from <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</ref>,

                            <item>Almost six decades after <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> started the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; 
                                two versions of the work were edited for publication. One version, 
                                prepared by <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> 
                                for <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</ref>, 
                                consisted solely of verse extracts, in keeping with the parameters of <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s anthology. 
                                A second version, edited by <persName corresp="#ETC">E. T. Cook</persName> and

                                used <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s version as a base text, 
                                but folded in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s complementary prose sections 
                                from <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX</ref> along with some additional verse

                            <item>Both of these edited versions used the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX</ref> fair copy as main copytext, 
                                supplemented by draft from <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php">MS VIII</ref> in order to represent the full scope of the 
                                <date when="1833">1833</date> tour. Both versions also preferred <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s revised texts of

                                although printing those poems&#x02BC; earlier versions in the notes. 
                                <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s version was the first to reproduce a page 
                                from <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX</ref> exemplifying <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s integration of text and picture. 
                                <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s edition reproduced sketches that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made during the actual tour (these also reprinted in the Library Edition version). 
                                Thus, the Library Edition edition version comes closest to realizing <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s intentions 
                                for the composite&#x2010;genre version of the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; considered as a reflection of illustrated travelogues of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>, 
                                whereas <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s version seems constructed as a biographical souvenir of the <date when="1833">1833</date> tour. 
                                <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> did not justify his editorial procedures for the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; and he is unlikely to have derived textual authority 
                                for an all&#x2010;verse version from <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</ref>, 
                                which he appears not to have known (see gloss, line 2, <ref type="witness" target="calais_poem_1891.php">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</ref>). 
                                In light of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s dismissive remarks about the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; in chapter 4 (<date when="1885">1885</date>) of the autobiography, <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>, 
                                it is unlikely that the now elderly <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> contributed to <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s editing, 
                                except by indirectly encouraging the biographical approach that underpins <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s procedure&#x2014;and 
                                even in this respect, the editor elaborated his own story about the Ruskins&#x02BC; <date when="1833">1833</date> Continental tour,

                                the columns list vertically the separate verse and prose sections and illustrations of the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; 
                                as they appear sequentially in the manuscripts or parts of manuscripts containing the work. 
                                Horizontally, the columns represent a rough chronological order, from the conjecturally earliest to the latest of the manuscripts, 
                                ending with the versions of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; edited for publication; however, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> likely worked on more than one of these manuscripts simultaneously&#x2014;especially,

                                so the sequence of composition, section by section, cannot be recovered in very specific detail. 
                                Nonetheless, in a broad view, the table represents <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s developing intentions. 
                                This table also provides information about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s system of line numbering, 
                                which he attached to the verse sections of some manuscripts, 
                                and which may provide clues about the sequence of composition.</item>

                                To the right of this first vertical column, additional columns indicate where drafts or fair copies of these respective prose or verse sections 
                                or illustrations can be located in surviving manuscripts or published versions. In other words,

                                    In n. 1 on p. 361, the editors print what they represent as draft lines in <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.php">MS VIII</ref>,

                        <p>The larger hypothesis advanced here concerning the composition of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; is that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            developed the work in stages, from a verse travelogue in the eighteenth&#x2010;century topographical manner&#x2014;as 
                            represented by <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</ref>, 
                            a collaboration with <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x2014;to a composite&#x2010;genre, illustrated travelogue that reflected the material culture 
                            surrounding the ekphrastic and travel&#x2010;related publishing of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. 
                            In so doing, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> worked toward invention of the persona, “J.R.,” who signed the culminating publication of the project, <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</ref>, 
                            published in the fashionable <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">literary annual</ref>,

                            With the project of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; founded in a poetic collaboration with his father, 
                            and elaborated in response to his surrounding material culture of ekphrastic and topographical publication, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s devising of his first literary persona represents the work of both the youth himself and his editors and literary mentors. 
                            Traces of editorial intervention can be encountered only sporadically in the manuscript record, however, 
                            and evidence about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s interaction with the editor,

                                The case for this manuscript as the earliest extant surviving draft of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; is based on the fact that its markup for revision 
                                (e.g., deletions, substitutions, transposition of lines) is incorporated into the 
                                <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair copy</ref>, 
                                and on the assumption that this group of poems about the Ruskins&#x02BC; first leg of their Continental journey, 
                                from <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> and along the <geogName corresp="#MEUSE">Meuse River</geogName>, 
                                formed a logical compositional starting point for the work.</p>

                                than of the Byronic or Dickensian manner of travel narration that marked <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s first decade as an author

                                similarly to how the earlier published texts of

                                stand in relation to that work&#x02BC;s repackaging in <date when="1830">1830</date> as an illustrated travelogue.</p>
                            <p>One might argue that <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</ref>, 
                                does not witness a distinct version of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; project, one conceived as travelogue solely in verse, 
                                but rather draft that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intended to incorporate directly into the composite&#x2010;genre 
                                <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair copy</ref>. 
                                That hypothesis cannot be disproven; however, evidence weighs more heavily in favor of this manuscript as representing a distinct stage of the work, 
                                in that no other draft manuscript of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; consists solely of verse, and in that this manuscript physically suggests 
                                what was originally meant as a self&#x2010;standing fair copy, which was later subjected to revision. 
                                In arrangement of lines on the manuscript, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s large, eighteenth&#x2010;century hand required the full width of sheet 1, 
                                and <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> sustained his father&#x02BC;s column in narrower scope and a smaller hand; however, on the verso of sheet 2, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> stacked the lines in double columns, as if imitating a printed copy. 
                                (He inserted the final poem in the sequence, <ref type="witness" target="the_meuse_poem_msia_g1.php">&#x201C;The Meuse&#x201D;</ref>, 
                                sideways in space remaining on the recto of sheet 2, rather than starting a third sheet, 
                                further substantiating the sense of the manuscript as a self&#x2010;contained entity.) The few substitutions&#x2014;all 
                                apparently in <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s hand, but not certainly so, especially in the case of overwriting&#x2014;are largely made as strikethroughs, 
                                with insertions above or below the line, and never as in&#x2010;line revisions, 
                                suggesting that these changes formed a distinct stage of this manuscript&#x02BC;s development, following its original purpose as a fair copy. 
                                Moreover, in the margins of both sheets, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> numbered the lines of the poems sequentially and continuously (1&#x2013;173); 
                                that is, he did not begin his line numbering anew with each poem, suggesting that he regarded the poems as forming a sequence </p>

                                This manuscript differs in size and appearance from

                                Unlike <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1, this manuscript was rough draft from inception, with many in&#x2010;line revisions. 
                                Its place in the evolution of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; appears to be a transitional one between the all&#x2010;verse and the composite&#x2010;genre versions, 
                                since it contains not only both prose and verse but also a selection of sections that seems strategic, although the exact purpose of the selection is obscure. 
                                The manuscript begins with draft of the first prose section of the 
                                <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair copy</ref> 
                                (which incorporates the changes made to the draft), but the prose is followed by drafts of poems that, 
                                in topographical terms of the actual tour, skip far ahead of the family&#x02BC;s landing at <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName>, as if presenting highlights of the tour.</p>
                            <p>The destinations represented by the draft poems are widely spaced but not random. 
                                The manuscript&#x02BC;s four poems form two pairs, one pair consisting of two nearly adjacent Italian destinations,

                                before he broke off in the middle of the section on &#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D; (although even that trio of sections in MS IX shows gaps for illustrations, 
                                the drawings either having been removed or having never been produced at all).

                                It appears that <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g2.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2</ref>, reflects a turning point 
                                in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s reconsideration of the genre of the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; 
                                in which he drafted the prose to accompany the opening poem,

                                and in which he sketched out two paired poetic representations of later

                                The logical inference is that, by <date notBefore="1834-02-13" notAfter="1834-02-28">the middle to late February 1834</date>,

                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> assembled verse and prose from his MS IA and MS VIII draft, to form topographical units describing major destinations 
                            along the family&#x02BC;s tour. Each unit typically consists of a poem in the picturesque mode, followed by a prose piece in a comic or anecdotal mode, 
                            and with the writing encased in illustrations mimicking the appearance of engravings or lithographs, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drew on separate slips and pasted into place. 
                            He modeled the layout on the <date when="1830">1830</date> edition of the topographical poem, <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, 
                            by <persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName>, an edition illustrated by engraved vignettes after drawings primarily 
                            by <persName corresp="#JMWT">J. M. W. Turner</persName> for landscapes, and by <persName corresp="#TSP">Thomas Stothard</persName> for figures, 
                            and also including minor illustrations by <persName corresp="#SP">Samuel Prout</persName> and others. 
                            In his own illustrations, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> imitates the appearance of these steel engravings, 
                            in some cases adopting <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s manner for landscapes and <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>&#x02BC;s for figures, according to his purposes in the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> also imitates <persName corresp="#SP">Samuel Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s style of architectural drawing along with the watery appearance of lithography,

                            than <date when="1834-02">February 1834</date>, when he started on the

                            and possibly somewhat beyond that date, the content of the draft gradually converged with the pace of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s fair&#x2010;copying in MS IX. 
                            While the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php">MS VIII draft of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;</ref>

                        <p>Several blank spaces in the manuscript mark places for drawings, and one cannot determine the difference between a gap where a drawing has gone missing

                            All of these drawings depict mountain scenes. The blank versos facing each of these 7 pages would not have been adequate

                            <p>This timetable also accords well with a <date when="1834-03-10">10 March 1834</date> verse epistle by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to his father,

                                which is remarkable for <hi rend="italic">not</hi> mentioning the <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> commissions. 
                                In this rhymed letter, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drops the idea of sending some observations on natural history to the editor, 
                                <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="loudon_j_c_note.php">John Claudius Loudon (1783&#x2013;1843)</ref>, 
                                to be considered for publication in the <hi rend="italic">Magazine of Natural History</hi>, so it seems surprising that 
                                he would have failed to add a couplet or two celebrating his submissions to another editor, <persName corresp="#TP">Thomas Pringle</persName> 
                                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 285).
                                It seems more likely that, at this time, no arrangements had as yet been made with <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x2014;or that, 
                                if <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> had approached the editor, <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> as yet knew nothing about an impending professional debut as a poet. As recently as <date when="1834-01-22">22 January 1834</date>, 
                                <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> had written to <persName corresp="#JH">James Hogg</persName> for advice about cultivating <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s poetic talents (pointing to the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; as an example), but 
                                expressing misgivings about exposing his son to the public as a prodigy. This letter&#x2014;in which <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> renewed contact with <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> abruptly, and following a long hiatus 
                                in the family&#x02BC;s slight relationship with the famed Scottish writer&#x2014;suggests that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> was already contemplating publication of <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry, 
                                but the letter also reveals the caution with which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s parents treated such a momentous possibility. 
                                Notably, the letter mentions no specific plans having been hatched with <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>, who was a longtime friend of <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s

                            <p><persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> was sent a sampling of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s verse (possibly a selection from the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;), 
                                to which he responded with a critique (seconded by his children&#x02BC;s tutor) that does not survive, 
                                but that <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> characterized as treating him with lenience while laying stress on the derivativeness of his verse. 
                                When <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> replied gratefully to <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> on <date when="1834-02-13">13 February 1834</date>, 
                                he had received an invitation to visit the <persName corresp="#JH">Ettrick Shepherd</persName> on his farm in Scotland (which <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> declined), 
                                but he apparently had received no direct encouragement to publish 
                                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GARDENMEMORIALS">Garden, ed., <hi rend="italic">Memorials of James Hogg</hi></ref>, 276&#x2013;77). 
                                One can only speculate whether <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> had a hand subsequently in prompting his friends&#x2014;the 
                                editor, <persName corresp="#TP">Thomas Pringle</persName>, and the publisher, <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName>&#x2014;to consider <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> as a contributor to <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi>, 
                                a publication that had benefited by <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s own contributions. (The prompting may have worked in the opposite direction, with <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> encouraging <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> 
                                to apply to <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> for advice.) One can only speculate, further, whether <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName>&#x02BC;s introduction of the prodigy to <persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName>&#x2014;which 
                                may have occurred at this time, but concerning which no contemporary evidence is known&#x2014;had any bearing on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s public appearance as &#x201C;J.R.&#x201D;

                                <hi rend="italic">Magazine of Natural History</hi>&#x2014;two important facts emerge: that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> considered <persName corresp="#JCL">Loudon</persName>, another Scot, to be a &#x201C;friend,&#x201D; 
                                and that the boy had the confidence to propose the submission himself

                            <p>Perhaps the choice was an acknowledgment that, in the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php">MS IX fair copy</ref> of the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; 
                                &#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D; forms a thematic bridge between &#x201C;Andernacht&#x201D; and &#x201C;St. Goar,&#x201D; a connection that

                                1:268). <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was therefore to some degree influenced by <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName>&#x02BC;s manipulation of the bibliographical record in favor of juvenile poems 
                                that <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName> could forge in the form of &#x201C;rare&#x201D; pamphlets (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WISERUSKINI">Dearden, &#x201C;Wise and Ruskin I&#x201D;</ref>, 46&#x2013;47; 
                                and <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="forgery_and_piracy_note.php">Forgery and Piracy</ref>).</p>
                            <p>The tendency to think of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; as a verse travelogue gained impetus from the elder <persName corresp="#JJR">Ruskin</persName> himself, 
                                who in <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> characterized it as &#x201C;a rhymed history of the tour&#x201D; and a &#x201C;poetical account of our tour, 
                                in imitation of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>&#x201D; (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35:81). 
                                <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> quotes this characterization in his description of <ref type="apparatus" target="apparatus_msix.php">MS IX</ref>, 
                                thus implicitly pointing to some authority for presenting the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; as a verse travelogue. He realized, however, that in the manuscripts available to him, 
                                the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; consisted of both &#x201C;prose and verse&#x201D;; and if pressed, since he had no knowledge of the all&#x2010;verse version in

                                of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; was tendentious: in boyhood, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> &#x201C;had intended this volume [<ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">the MS IX fair copy</ref>] 
                                to contain about 150 pieces of prose and poetry, and at least as many drawings! . . . I am pretty certain that . . . [when writing <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>] was not aware of the amount of material existing in rough copies at the back of his book&#x2010;shelves,&#x201D; 
                                referring to MS VII, MS VIII, and MS XI

                                He prefaces his edition of the work with a passage from <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> describes the family setting out on the

                                and he was interested in the materials &#x201C;existing in rough copies at the back of . . . [<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s] book&#x2010;shelves,&#x201D; 
                                because the trove afforded him verse to fill out the topographical sequence to the full extent of the family&#x02BC;s tour. 
                                Where these materials lacked titles, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> provided identifying place&#x2010;names 
                                (see <ref type="internal" target="#TITLE">Title</ref>), sometimes on slender evidence, in order to situate poems in a topographical order. 
                                From the same motive, apparently, he reproduced only drawings that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made during the tour itself, 
                                instead of illustrating his edition with the phenomenal <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">the MS IX fair copy</ref>.

                            the line numbering begins following the prose section for <ref type="witness" target="calais_prose_msia_g2.php">&#x201C;Calais&#x201D;</ref>,

                            and running continuously from poem to poem, to line no. 429. Since the poems in this manuscript could never have been conceived as sequentially ordered

                            can be lined up directly against the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair copy</ref>.</p>

                            suggests that he initiated the numbering scheme before he even conceived the plan for the fair copy. 
                            Whatever its function, the mechanical quality of the numbering, along with the lack of any appearance of its having been added at a later time, 
                            tends to reinforce the evidence that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> composed draft of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; in a straightforward sequence, 
                            as suggested by the regular, uncrowded appearance of the manuscripts&#x2014;despite the helter&#x2010;skelter leaping around the map in topographical subjects.</p>
                        <p>In the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php">MS VIII draft sequence</ref>, 
                            there may exist minor, localized confusions in sequence of composition, 
                            which are concealed by the apparently straightforward line numbering. For example, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            started the prose section for <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> on 62r, 
                            three&#x2010;quarters of the way down the page, and entitled it 
                            <ref type="witness" target="part_of_brussels_prose1_msviii.php">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; [part 1]</ref>. 
                            This draft extends halfway through 62v, where it stops in mid&#x2010;sentence (&#x201C;. . . circumnavigating,&#x201D; 
                            substituted for <del>traversing</del>), followed by a poem, 
                            <ref type="witness" target="oh_softly_blew_the_mounting_breeze_msviii.php">&#x201C;Oh softly blew the mounting breeze&#x201D;</ref> 
                            (entitled <ref type="witness" target="chiavenna_poem_1891.php">&#x201C;Chiavenna&#x201D;</ref> in <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (<date when="1891">1891</date>) 
                            and in the <ref type="witness" target="chiavenna_poem_le.php">Library Edition version</ref>). 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> numbered the poem&#x02BC;s lines 810&#x2013;22, 
                            which is continuous with a previous installment of verse (lines 778&#x2013;809), for a quite different poem, 
                            <ref type="witness" target="oh_the_morn_looked_bright_over_hill_and_dale_msviii.php">&#x201C;Oh the morn looked bright over hill and dale&#x201D; [&#x201C;The Black Forest&#x201D;]&#x201D;</ref>). 
                            The remainder of the prose passage on <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName>, 
                            <ref type="witness" target="part_of_brussels_prose2_msviii.php">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; [part 2]</ref> 
                            (taken up in mid&#x2010;line, &#x201C;perambulating . . . tread on it softly&#x201D;) begins at the top of the next recto, 63r, 
                            and it is completed on 63v.</p>
                        <p>One inference is that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrapped the prose around the poem, 
                            already drafted in its place, on 62v. It is equally possible, however, that the sequence of composition was what it appears to be, 
                            but that the abrupt shifts between prose and poetry provide a clue about the process of fair&#x2010;copying 
                            (provided that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had begun work in <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX</ref> by this point). 
                            In the fair copy of this prose passage for <ref type="witness" target="brussels_prose_msix.php">&#x201C;Brussels&#x201D;</ref>, 
                            a line of text ends with the break&#x2010;point in the draft, &#x201C;circumnavigating for&#x201D;&#x2014;with 
                            the &#x201C;for&#x201D; jammed against the justified right margin. The next line resumes with &#x201C;perambulating.&#x2014;Oh woe to the weather&#x201D; etc. 
                            One might infer, then, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> fair&#x2010;copied 
                            <ref type="witness" target="part_of_brussels_prose1_msviii.php">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; [part 1]</ref> in 
                            <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair copy</ref> as far as he had drafted the prose in MS VIII (62v); 
                            crossed out the last word in MS VIII draft on 62v (<del>traversing</del>), since he could not fit it on the line in the 
                            <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair copy</ref> 
                            (hence, the tightly fitted, almost run&#x2010;together &#x201C;circumnavigating, for&#x201D;); 
                            then stopped fair&#x2010;copying the prose in <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX</ref>, 
                            in order to draft the poem that falls next in <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php">MS VIII</ref>, 
                            <ref type="witness" target="oh_softly_blew_the_mounting_breeze_msviii.php">&#x201C;Oh softly blew the mounting breeze&#x201D;</ref> 
                            (and numbered its lines accurately in sequence); and finally resumed drafting prose with 
                            <ref type="witness" target="part_of_brussels_prose2_msviii.php">&#x201C;Part of Brussels&#x201D; [part 2]</ref>, 
                            but changed his mind about the next word (making it &#x201C;perambulating,&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;traversing&#x201D;).</p>
                        <p>In this case, either scenario is supported by the evidence of the line numbering and the appearance of the draft. 
                            One conclusion that might be drawn from both scenarios is that fair&#x2010;copying was as important to 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> as composition. Another inference is the unsettledness of his imagination, 
                            which could danced so mercurially from prose to verse, from the memory of <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> 
                            to evoking the <placeName corresp="#BLACKFOREST">Black Forest</placeName>.</p>
                        <p>A hazard of interpreting <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s line numbering in 
                            <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msviii.php">MS VIII</ref> is that it can lead to ambiguity about what verse 
                            he intended for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; project. Following the <date when="1833-05">May 1833</date> birthday ode for his father, 
                            <ref type="apparatus"  target="my_fathers_birthday_the_month_of_may_apparatus.php">&#x201C;My Father&#x02BC;s Birthday: The Month of May&#x201D;</ref>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first applied the numbering (line no. 506) to 
                            <ref type="witness" target="oh_are_there_spirits_can_there_be_poem_msviii.php">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits, can there be&#x201D;</ref>, 
                            a poem that he did not fair&#x2010;copy in <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX</ref>, 
                            and that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> as well as 
                            <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> hesitated to identify as part of the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> separated the poem from the preceding birthday ode by a horizontal line&#x2014;a 
                            designation used throughout <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.php">MS VIII</ref> to divide one work from another&#x2014;but 
                            he supplied no title for the new piece in particular or for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; in general, 
                            which would have helpfully signaled where the draft for the topographical work begins. 
                            The sole clue that the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; draft begins with this poem is its line numbering, 
                            which is not attached to the preceding <date when="1831">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833">33</date> poetry in 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="ms_viii_apparatus.php#CONTENTS">MS VIII: Contents, Section <hi rend="italic">a</hi></ref>, 
                            but that does run throughout the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; draft. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, 
                            one must assume that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intended 
                            <ref type="witness" target="oh_are_there_spirits_can_there_be_poem_msviii.php">&#x201C;Oh are there spirits, can there be&#x201D;</ref> 
                            for the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; despite the difficulty of situating the poem in the fair copy. 
                            (And one must understand the poem&#x02BC;s reference to spiritual presences, rather than to visible topography, 
                            as a significant aspect of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s thinking about his first journey abroad&#x2014;particularly 
                            the mountain scenery that may form the context of this lyric, with <ref type="witness" target="source_of_the_arveron_prose_msviii.php">&#x201C;Source of the Arveron&#x201D;</ref> 
                            falling next in sequence, which likewise evokes spiritual presences.</p>
                        <p>This discussion is provided as a demonstration of how <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s line numbering might be used as evidence in establishing the contents and development of the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; 
                            Use of this evidence always calls for caution, since the evidence is ambiguous in itself, and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was sometimes inconsistent in how he applied the numbering.

                            he extended the numbering system from draft poetry for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; into verse that clearly does not belong to the project,

                            might be viewed as a gradual recovery and conjectural reconstruction of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s final intentions for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;&#x2014;a steady editorial advance toward realizing 
                            his elaborately composite&#x2010;genre, albeit uncompleted <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair&#x2010;copy version</ref>. 
                            From the publication in <date when="1834">1834</date> and <date when="1850">1850</date> by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s earliest editors, along with <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s oversight, of &#x201C;fragments&#x201D; from a putative &#x201C;metrical journal,&#x201D; 
                            to the reconstruction in <date when="1891">1891</date> by <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> of a solely metrical journal that traced the full itinerary 
                            of the <date when="1833">1833</date> journey, to the restoration in <date when="1903">1903</date> by <persName corresp="#ETC">E. T.

                            step in this history might be read teleologically as advancing toward realizing <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s final vision for the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; by steadily accruing more of its parts. 
                            The Library Edition version crowns this editorial trend by attempting to represent most comprehensively not only the portion of the project that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            fair&#x2010;copied and illustrated in the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX version</ref> but also the continuation 
                            of the project that he planned to form a greater whole in his

                            and that he partly drafted in MS VII, MS VIII, and MS XI.</p>
                        <p>To see the editorial history as a steady advancement and simple expansion toward a single ideal text would imply, however, 
                            that each of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s editors projected the same ideal text. While all of these editors did presumably have access to sufficient evidence 
                            of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s largest ambitions for the project&#x2014;his composite&#x2010;genre version&#x2014;their respective treatments suggest conflicting views about a preferred ideal text. 
                            The question is complicated by the varying constraints of their publication venues (<hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi>, 
                            as an <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">annual</ref>, was meant to anthologize only brief lyric poems or tales, 
                            whereas the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php">Library Edition</ref> aimed at unprecedented completeness in collecting 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s works), but this external factor does not entirely determine the editors&#x02BC; differing ideas about how to represent the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; project 
                            most effectively or&#x2014;what was for the earlier editors inseparable from representation of the text&#x2014;their influence over <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s developing idea of authorship.</p>
                        <p>Initially, in terms of authorial intention and audience, and therefore of perceived ideal text, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and his editors worked at cross purposes.
                            In the study of modern manuscripts, Donald Reiman has argued for the importance of distinguishing between a manuscript&#x02BC;s status as 
                            <hi rend="italic">public</hi>, <hi rend="italic">private</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">confidential</hi>&#x2014;a distinction that depends, &#x201C;not [on] its degree of 
                            [rhetorical or aesthetic] artfulness or the level of personal intimacy between the writer and its readers but the nature and extent of the writer&#x02BC;s intended audience. 
                            A manuscript is <hi rend="italic">private</hi> if its author intended it to be read only by one person or a specific small group of people whose identity he knew in advance; 
                            <hi rend="italic">confidential</hi> if it was intended for a predefined but larger audience who may&#x2014;or may not&#x2014;be personally known to or interested in the author; 
                            and <hi rend="italic">public</hi> only if it was written to be published or circulated for perusal by a widespread, unspecified audience, including such abstractions 
                            as the nation, the reading public, and posterity&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#REIMANMODERNMANUSCRIPTS">Reiman, <hi rend="italic">The Study of Modern Manuscripts</hi></ref>, 65). 
                            In the case of the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s audience was private, in that he expected his productions to be read primarily by his family, but also confidential, 
                            in that his parents shared his work with friends whose identity he could not predict. For example, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could not have predicted that samples of his verse

                            as less confidential than private in Reiman&#x02BC;s terms. A &#x201C;journal&#x201D; belonging to &#x201C;J.R.&#x201D; seems mysteriously private 
                            in keeping with the nineteenth&#x2010;century cult of the personal, which, as Reiman remarks, led to a fashion for collecting autograph manuscripts

                            having eliminated the prose pieces that affect an easy, confidentially personal tone, while revising the MS IX versions of

                            in their published versions. What <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had produced as a confidential, imitatively &#x201C;public&#x201D; manuscript in the

                        <p>This sense of the editor as holding insider&#x02BC;s knowledge was enhanced by the publication of

                            For many recipients of that volume, the title must have suggested merely that the editors were adding another &#x201C;fragment&#x201D; 
                            to the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_fo.php">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</ref> 
                            that had so far been made public&#x2014;if, indeed, the title meant even that much, 
                            given that the volume did not reprint the two poems that had formed the original &#x201C;Fragments,&#x201D; 
                            published sixteen years earlier. For readers to perceive this publication as more than just a compounding of fragments&#x2014;rather, 
                            as a sophisticated reinstatement of a missing middle poem that, 
                            in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair copy</ref>, 
                            had bridged the two poems, which were later separated and published as a more severely contrasting pair in 
                            <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi>&#x2014;would 
                            have required a perceptive critical reading of the three fragments considered as a unit, 
                            a reading that would in turn have relied on a comprehensive knowledge of the textual history of the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; 
                            Besides <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself, perhaps only <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> and <persName corresp="#WHH">W. H. Harrison</persName> possessed that privileged and knowledgable perspective. 
                            Since this edition was printed for private circulation, the editors were in a position to share their privileged knowledge with readers. 
                            Still, for many of the original recipients of the volume (as well as for the collectors who acquired copies later), 
                            <ref type="witness" target="ehrenbreitstein_poem_1850.php">&#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein: Fragment from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</ref> 
                            would not have been perceived less as opening up an ideal text of the hitherto unknown portions of a &#x201C;metrical journal,&#x201D; 
                            than as testifying to a private and privileged story about the former omission of this &#x201C;fragment.&#x201D; As <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> wrote to <persName corresp="#WHH">Harrison</persName>, 
                            clarifying his intention regarding the audience of the <date when="1850">1850</date> collection, &#x201C;the Book although apparently so is not intended to be anonymous 
                            in a Single Instance [i.e., of selections included in the anthology]. It is only <hi rend="underline">denied</hi> the public&#x201D; 
                            (Durham, <date when="1850-03-24">24 March 1850</date> [MSL 003/004/096], in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MSL003-004">Letters from John James Ruskin to W. H. Harrison, 1838&#x2013;1853</ref>).</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> situated himself in this tradition of the privileged editor, by virtue of his decision to restrict his <date when="1891">1891</date> edition to poetry, 
                            reserving an edition of early prose for a separate volume (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1850_note.php">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [1850]</ref>). 
                            Now, the audience for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; was again public, but inflected by the culture of rare book collecting, which created a new audience of eager and competitive consumers 
                            for rare copies of the <date when="1850">1850</date> <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> by &#x201C;J.R.&#x201C; Thus, in one sense, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s version maintains the tradition 
                            of allowing public access to only fragments from a private horde&#x2014;so private that not even <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself, much less the collector privileged by mere cash 
                            to own the <date when="1850">1850</date> <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi>, was &#x201C;aware of the amount of material [for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;] existing in rough copies at the back of . . . [<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s] book&#x2010;shelves&#x201D; 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#PUBLICATION1891">Publication: 1891</ref>). In another sense, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> could re&#x2010;frame the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; as a public work, 
                            available to an anonymous audience, since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had told its story in <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>. <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> signals this orientation by quoting long, contextualizing passages 
                            from the autobiography at the head of the poem and in his notes; and his his version of the text, which expands the verse selections to cover the full scope of the <date when="1833">1833</date> tour, 
                            serves as a poetic, documentary gloss on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s prose autobiographical narration of the master&#x02BC;s first significant experience of Continental landscape and towns. 
                            Yet, if <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> relies on the autobiography to authorize his version of a public text, 
                            his all&#x2010;verse version can claim only faulty authority relative to the manuscript &#x201C;material . . . at the back of . . . [<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s] book&#x2010;shelves,&#x201D; 
                            for this version is not the young <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s composite&#x2010;genre &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; Ironically, 
                            the manuscript that would have supplied some authorization for such a version&#x2014;the all&#x2010;verse, and perhaps more private collaboration between <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and his father, 
                            <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php">MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1</ref>&#x2014;was unknown to <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s version therefore was a step toward an ideal text of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s original intentions for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; only in a limited sense. 
                            As if jealous even of the public dimension that he afforded the work by constructing it as a tour poem illustrative of <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>, 
                            <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> substituted a new narrative in his <date when="1894">1894</date> biography, 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WGCLIFEOFJR1893"><hi rend="italic">Life and Work of John Ruskin</hi></ref>, 
                            suggesting that <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s motives in making the work were furtive and separate from his father&#x02BC;s interests, 
                            a closely held harbinger of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mature mission in <hi rend="italic">Modern Painters</hi> 
                            (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HANSONRUSKIN1830S">Hanson, &#x201C;Ruskin in the 1830s&#x201D;</ref>). 
                            This conception is almost the opposite of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s intention in his youth, which was to imitate a public work of his own time&#x2014;an 
                            imitation of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, as acknowledged in <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>&#x2014;and which 
                            was meant to be confidentially shared with readers who qualified as &#x201C;men of talent and of heart.&#x201D; 
                            Thus, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s version was a step toward restoration of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s original youthful project only in the sense that it provided an expanded framework, 
                            which <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> could dramatically fill out with the poems&#x02BC; missing complementary prose pieces, and with (at least) one reproduction of a hand&#x2010;illustrated page, along with footnotes describing 
                            the remaining drawings and where in the work they are placed. The Library Edition&#x02BC;s version is the first genuine attempt at representing <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s work 
                            as originally conceptualized. At the same time, <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> inherited the agendas of their predecessors, and they too inevitably framed the work also 
                            as supplemental material illustrating <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s autobiography.</p>

                            This work, which was indeed published that spring with <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> listed among the printed list of subscribers, 
                            is credited by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, doubtless apocryphally, with having prompted the family&#x02BC;s tour spontaneously, 
                            whereas the journey must in fact have long been in planning: 
                            &#x201C;as my mother watched my father&#x02BC;s pleasure and mine in looking at the wonderful places, she said, why should we not go and see some of them in reality? 
                            My father hesitated a little, then with glittering eyes said&#x2014;why not? And there were two or three weeks of entirely rapturous and amazed preparation&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 39:79). It was likely the case, however, 
                            that <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName> helped to orient the family to the north of Europe, as <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> oriented them to the southern region of the Continent 
                            (see <ref type="italic" target="#ITINERARY">Itinerary and Tourism</ref>).</p>
                        <p>While these two publications of course did not hold exclusive sway over either the Ruskins&#x02BC; tour itinerary or <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s embodiment of their experiences in the <title corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>, 
                            <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s books did play an important and representative role in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s conceptualization of his family&#x02BC;s northern and southern destinations, 
                            and in the interplay of tourism and the materiality of travel writing and publication in the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. 
                            <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#PROUTSKETCHES"><hi rend="italic">Facsimiles</hi></title> provided a pictorial tour through 
                            <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>, 
                            whereas <persName corresp="#SP">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> led the reader on the more traditional Grand Tour of the South. 
                            The books contrasted also in their material representations. The <hi rend="italic">Facsimiles</hi> consists of fifty lithographic prints 
                            of picturesque medieval and Renaissance architectural sites in northern <geogName corresp="#EUROPE">Europe</geogName>, and it contains no letterpress&#x2014;only 
                            the place names lettered directly onto the lithographic stone, as part of the image, to identify the locales depicted. 
                            The lithographs, then a new medium in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>, would have struck the Ruskins with their dramatically large size 
                            (22 by 15 inches) and watercolor&#x2010;like texture, as compared with the exquisite preciousness of the finely etched, steel&#x2010;engraved vignettes 
                            (2&#x2013;3 inches by 3&#x2013;4 inches) that illustrate <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1830">1830</date>
                            <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>. (A more typical size for the engraved area of steel&#x2010;engraved book illustration was 7 by 5 inches 
                            [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HUNNISETTSTEELENGRAVED">Hunnisett, <hi rend="italic">Steel&#x2010;Engraved Book Illustration in England</hi></ref>, 35].) 
                            <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> was also a more traditional work, despite its up&#x2010;to&#x2010;date reliance on the 
                            new technologies of steel engraving and mass production that sponsored the boom in <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</ref>. 
                            <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s verse and taste were late&#x2010;eighteenth&#x2010;century in manner, and his <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> could not compete in popularity with 
                            <persName corresp="#GGB">Lord Byron</persName>&#x02BC;s fourth part of <title type="poem" corresp="#BYRONPILGRIMAGE"><hi rend="italic">Childe Harold&#x02BC;s Pilgrimage</hi></title>, which is set in <placeName corresp="#VENICE">Venice</placeName>. 
                            <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s poem gained popular acclaim solely by means of the <date when="1830">1830</date> edition&#x02BC;s graphic enhancements 
                            (see <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="samuel_rogers_note.php">Samuel Rogers (1763&#x2013;1855)</ref>).</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <title corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title> underwent a development parallel to that of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s work, from a travelogue written solely in verse and in an eighteenth&#x2010;century manner 
                            of topographical poetry, to an illustrated composite&#x2010;genre travel narrative typical of the steel&#x2010;engraved landscape <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">annuals</ref> 
                            of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date> (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>). As remarked above, there is some ambiguity concerning when the Ruskin family 
                            acquired a copy of the <date when="1830">1830</date> illustrated edition of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, which they already owned in an earlier, non&#x2010;illustrated version. 
                            Regardless of when the book entered the household, however, its influence is palpable from the start of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair copy</ref>. Critics have focused too exclusively on <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title> 
                            as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s model, at the cost tracing his imitation of <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#PROUTSKETCHES"><hi rend="italic">Facsimiles</hi></title> 
                            (see, e.g., <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SPEARRUSKINSITALY">Spear, &#x201C;Ruskin&#x02BC;s Italy&#x201D;</ref>), 
                            but it is true that <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s book frames the foundational layout and conception of the composite&#x2010;genre <title corresp="#JRACCOUNTTOUR">&#x201C;Account&#x201D;</title>. 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> modeled his section divisions on <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s layout, observing how text and illustration form a coherent unit. 
                            Like <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>, he entitles his topographical sections so as to identify a landmark destination&#x2014;&#x201C;Calais,&#x201D; &#x201C;Cassel,&#x201D; &#x201C;Lille,&#x201D; &#x201C;Brussels,&#x201D; 
                            &#x201C;The Meuse,&#x201D; &#x201C;Aix la Chapelle,&#x201D; &#x201C;Cologne,&#x201D; &#x201C;Andernacht,&#x201D; &#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein,&#x201D; &#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D; and 
                            &#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D;&#x2014;and for these section titles, he uses a lettering that imitates <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s restrained display type. 
                            (&#x201C;St. Goar&#x201D; and &#x201C;Heidelberg&#x201D; are missing their headings, owing to the unfinished state of the fair copy.) 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s placement of illustration vis&#x2010;&#x00E0;&#x2010;vis text likewise imitates <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s layout, 
                            by heading the first page of each section with a landscape vignette, above the title, 
                            in order to situate the reader in a distinct place, and by closing each section with a figure vignette, as a tailpiece in order to caption some portion of the narrative.</p>
                        <p>In this arrangement of text and image, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> captured a notable innovation of the <date when="1830">1830</date> illustrated edition of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>. 
                            <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> probably based his layout on the admired designs by 
                            <persName corresp="#WBPUBLISHER">William Bulmer</persName> (<date notBefore="1757" notAfter="1830">1757&#x2013;1830</date>) for his <orgName corresp="SHAKSPEAREPRESS">Shakspeare Press</orgName>,<!-- DCH: do not alter spelling; this spelling is correct for Bulmer's press --> 
                            particularly <persName corresp="#WBPUBLISHER">Bulmer</persName>&#x02BC;s editions in the <date notBefore="1790" notAfter="1799">1790s</date> of English poets, with wood&#x2010;engraved vignettes by <persName corresp="TBENGRAVER">Thomas Bewick</persName> (<date notBefore="1753" notAfter="1828">1753&#x2013;1828</date>) 
                            set at the heads of title pages of the poems 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PIGGOTTTURNERSVIGNETTES">Piggott, <hi rend="italic">Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes</hi></ref>, 20).<!-- DCH: NEED REF FOR "FINE PRINTING" --> 
                            This elegant page layout was not possible in the mass&#x2010;produced 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</ref>, which first arose in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>. 
                            In order to achieve wide distribution, these popular books relied on the durability of steel engraving, 
                            an intaglio process that clashes with relief type. In the eighteenth&#x2010;century illustrated book, <persName corresp="TBENGRAVER">Bewick</persName>&#x02BC;s fine wood engravings could be set in the same frame as the type, 
                            allowing text and image to be printed together on the same page. To solve this problem, and achieve the elegant effects of <persName corresp="#WBPUBLISHER">Bulmer</persName>&#x02BC;s designs, 
                            and yet print the books on a massive scale, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s printers innovated a technique, 
                            which was widely remarked in reviews of the <date when="1830">1830</date> <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, 
                            whereby precise registration allowed the sheets to be run through the press twice, once for the engraving, and once for the type 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POWELLTURNERSVIGNETTES">Powell, &#x201C;Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes and the Making of Rogers&#x02BC; &#x2018;Italy&#x2019;&#x201D;</ref>, 3). 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was attentive to this up&#x2010;to&#x2010;date innovation.</p>
                        <p>But <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s fair&#x2010;copy version is not just an illustrated travel poem, but a composite&#x2010;genre travelogue, combining prose with verse and illustration. 
                            Although <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> is subtitled <hi rend="italic">A Poem</hi>, the author 
                            did include some prose&#x2014;brief essays and a tale&#x2014;in &#x201C;Part the Second&#x201D; (<date when="1828">1828</date>) of the work 
                            (&#x201C;National Prejudices,&#x201D; &#x201C;Caius Cestius,&#x201D; &#x201C;Foreign Travel,&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Bag of Gold,&#x201D; in 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROGERSITALY1828">Rogers, <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> (1828)</ref>, 
                            35&#x2013;40, 51&#x2013;52, 62&#x2013;71, 107&#x2013;19); and he reprinted these prose pieces and added two more tales to the <date when="1830">1830</date> edition 
                            (&#x201C;Marcolini&#x201D; and &#x201C;Marco Griffoni,&#x201D; in 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ROGERSITALY1830">Rogers, <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> (1830)</ref>, 
                            85&#x2013;87, 230&#x2013;32). But <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> disperses his few prose pieces irregularly, with at most a pattern of loose association 
                            with their immediately surrounding poems, whereas <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> constructs each of his topographical sections (with one exception), using both verse and prose. 
                            Unlike <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> does not independently title his prose pieces, but subordinates them to the topographical unit, 
                            separating prose from poem with a drawing, which serves as a hinge between the writing and binds the parts into an associative, but still coherent unit. 
                            While complementing the poems, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s prose pieces also contrast with his rather generalized, picturesque poetic views, by bringing them down to earth 
                            with first&#x2010;person, anecdotal and comedic commentary about specific locale.</p>
                        <p>By this arrangement, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> amplifies the pattern of text and illustration in the <date when="1830">1830</date> <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, which typically consists of a landscape vignette 
                            after a drawing by <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName> as a header, above a poem&#x02BC;s title, and a figure vignette after a drawing by <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName> as a tailpiece. While in its present condition, 
                            the <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair copy</ref> is missing many drawings 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#FAIRCOPY">Fair Copy</ref>), sufficient examples remain in place to confirm <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s intentions. 
                            Compared to <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; not only complements each poem with a prose piece, 
                            but also supplies each poem and prose piece with its own headpiece and tailpiece&#x2014;four vignettes in total 
                            for each topographical unit, the prose piece&#x02BC;s vignette serving as the hinge. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> honors <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s pattern of using a landscape or cityscape as a headpiece, 
                            and a figure drawing as tailpiece, but he varies the pattern somewhat (as does <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>) by occasionally heading a section or a prose piece 
                            with a more anecdotal, narrative vignette.</p>
                        <p>The most striking variation is the section on &#x201C;Aix la Chapelle,&#x201D; which begins with an imposing drawing 
                            in <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s manner of the city&#x02BC;s cathedral, followed by the section heading, but which proceeds with a prose piece only, and no poem. 
                            At the end of the section, the manuscript shows a large gap, which may have been meant to be filled by a tailpiece, but which was more likely reserved 
                            for the headpiece of the following section, &#x201C;Cologne&#x201D; (for which the heading is lettered at the bottom of the page). 
                            The condensation of this section&#x02BC;s parts into only a drawing and a prose piece contrasts with the expansion and elaboration that prevails in other sections. 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> carries the condensation into the prose commentary, which he writes in both the comic and the picturesque modes (the latter typically represented by verse 
                            in the &#x201C;Account&#x201D;), with the speaker first riffing on the <date when="1748-04-24">Peace of Aix la Chapelle</date> to mock the somnolent &#x201C;peace treaties&#x201D; governing the local postillions, 
                            but then rhapsodically describing with the sublimity of the cathedral&#x02BC;s interior in moonlight. Finally, the speaker parodies a guidebook&#x02BC;s art and artifact tour 
                            of the cathedral. Perhaps <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> chose &#x201C;Aix la Chapelle&#x201D; as an exercise in condensation in order to signify the city&#x02BC;s pivotal geographical position 
                            at the juncture of <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#NETHERLANDS">Netherlands</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>, and the its distinctive, imperial status.</p>
                        <p>At the opposite end of the spectrum, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> carries out the principle of elaborating <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s pattern to its fullest in the sections on &#x201C;Andernacht,&#x201D; 
                            &#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein,&#x201D; and &#x201C;St. Goar.&#x201D; The outer sections of the trio work as contrasts&#x2014;the first, gothic in mode; and the third, domestic. Between them, 
                            &#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D; plays with the topic of confluence, as the meeting point of the darkly gothic and of sunny domesticity, symbolized by the meeting point 
                            of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine River</geogName> and the <geogName corresp="#MOSELLE">Moselle River</geogName>. The fortress of <placeName corresp="#EHRENBREITSTEIN">Ehrenbreitstein</placeName> looms over the rivers&#x02BC; juncture, depicted by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in a vignette copied after <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>. 
                            Each of the sections is planned for the fullest complement of poetry, prose, and drawings; together, the three sections traverse an elaborate yet balanced 
                            range of topographical modes.</p>
                        <p>In his drawings imitating engravings, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> strives to harmonize his illustrations with text in the manner of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s landscape illustrator, 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="turner_j_m_w_note.php">J. M. W. Turner (1775&#x2013;1851)</ref>, 
                            who exploited the potential of fine&#x2010;lined but durable steel engraving to allow indefinite borders of an engraving to melt into the white space of the paper, 
                            creating a world within the page 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PIGGOTTTURNERSVIGNETTES">Piggott, <hi rend="italic">Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes</hi></ref>, 14&#x2013;16). 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s drawings emphasize how such frameless, soft&#x2010;edged rectangular, square, or oval designs harmonize 
                            with his left&#x2010; and right&#x2010;justified blocks of text to make a unity of effect. Less noticed is <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s attention to the contrasting textures of <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s lithographs, 
                            such as his copy of <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Liege,&#x201D; which concludes the section on &#x201C;The Meuse.&#x201D; Exacting as it is, the copy is not just mechanical, but an exploration of 
                            the anecdotal, touristic world of the traveler&#x02BC;s picturesque opened up by the fluid and watercolor&#x2010;like texture of a lithograph, 
                            as compared with the fairy world of light and exotic landscape revealed by the exquisite intaglio of <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName>&#x02BC;s vignettes. As the largest of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s drawings 
                            for the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; set broadside and filling an entire page of the MS IX notebook, the &#x201C;Liege&#x201D; copy comments also on the scale 
                            of <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s folio&#x2010;sized <hi rend="italic">Facsimiles</hi> as a contrast with the miniature vignette illustrations for <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>.</p>
                        <p>In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s liveliness of response to the material world of art production and reproduction that guided early Victorian picturesque travel, his achievement 
                            in the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; poses possibilities that are neglected by interpretations that insist on the narrow constraints and neuroticism of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early self&#x2010;instruction 
                            in drawing. For example, Paul H. Walton <!--persName?--> sees <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s adoption of <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;outline style&#x201D; of depicting old architecture with &#x201C;broken lines and dots&#x201D; 
                            as one example of the youth&#x02BC;s tendency &#x201C;to revert to pen and ink in more factual studies of picturesque buildings and views,&#x201D; 
                            owing to a misguided direction of &#x201C;his earliest art activity . . . along lines strictly defined by adult standards and ideas of what 
                            was educationally desirable, so that he was not encouraged, nor did he have the time, to draw in a playful way the kinds of figure subjects in which a child 
                            imaginatively expresses and defines a conception of himself within a framework of human relationships.&#x201D; As a contrast with this &#x201C;crippl[ing]&#x201D; of his 
                            imagination, which &#x201C;had much to do with the tragedy of his personal life,&#x201D; Walton points to &#x201C;the happy, normal family life of a boy&#x201D; like <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            later sexual nemesis, John Everett Millais, whose youthful drawings included the kind of &#x201C;subjects usually preferred by boy artists: 
                            soldiers, animals, machines, caricatures of family and friends.&#x201D; As a consequence, even when a prospect of freedom opened up in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s youthful art teaching, 
                            such as when his first drawing master, <ref type="note" target="runciman_charles_note.php">Charles Runciman (1798&#x2013;1864)</ref> challenged the boy &#x201C;to imitate the free, 
                            controlled sweep of the pencil in . . . [the teacher&#x02BC;s] models,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> retreated to his more formal depictions of buildings in pen and ink 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WALTONDRAWINGS">Walton, <hi rend="italic">Drawings of John Ruskin</hi></ref>, 13, 7, 8, 7, 6). 
                            It is not true, however, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s writing and drawings neglect subjects appropriate to &#x201C;boy artists&#x201D;; 
                            more importantly, Walton&#x02BC;s division of the normative from the creative, laden with convention, omits how spontaneity and invention can be prompted 
                            in surprising ways, and one of these is <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s playfulness in manipulating the material culture surrounding a youth of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. Just as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> not only amuses himself 
                            with shrinking the dimensions of the &#x201C;Aix la Chapelle&#x201D; section, but also insightfully considers how he can work within these self&#x2010;imposed contraints 
                            to make his prose for this section compensate for the lack of a poem by multiplying its registers of effect, 
                            so he both playfully and meaningfully shrinks the scale of his Proutesque drawing 
                            for the &#x201C;Lille&#x201D; section, with its topic of recession and expansion through motion&#x2014;the travelers receding &#x201C;Farther and farther . . . / From <placeName corresp="#CASSEL">Cassel</placeName>s insulated crest&#x201D; to where &#x201C;Lille upon us sudden 
                            broke&#x201D; in its &#x201C;rich irregularity&#x201D; of &#x201C;form and figure fair, / . . . moving, breathing, living there&#x201D; (<ref type="witness" target="lille_poem_msix.php">"Lille"</ref>, 
                            lines 11&#x2013;12, 32, 38&#x2013;40). In a contrasting strategy, he swells his Proutesque drawing of the facade of Aachen Cathedral for &#x201C;Aix la Chapelle&#x201D; to almost 
                            a full page, in keeping with the prose description of a monumental cathedral as &#x201C;a noble, a beautiful, a sublime thing&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="witness" target="aix_la_chapelle_prose_msix.php">&#x201C;Aix la Chapelle&#x201D;</ref>).</p>
                        <p>Viewed in this way, the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; seems less the &#x201C;unfinished folly&#x201D; that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            condemned in <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35:81), 
                            than a project that had yielded as much creative potential as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could teach himself, 
                            despite his compulsively listing future additions to the work on the back flyleaves of <ref type="apparatus" target="msviii_apparatus.php">MS VIII</ref>. 
                            The project propelled him forward into active participation as the author, &#x201C;J.R.,&#x201D; in the material culture of ekphrastic and topographical

                            <p>For British travelers in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1839">1820s&#x2013;30s</date>, emergent developments in touristic experience were perhaps most vivid in new and less familiar routes 
                            opening up in northern Europe alongside the well&#x2010;worn path of the Grand Tour to <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>.

                            comparatively unfamiliar except as a route to be got over as quickly as possible on the way to <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>. 
                            While in <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> exaggerates the solitary significance of

                            journey, the artist&#x02BC;s early importance to British perceptions of northern Europe is corroborated by the novelty of his representations of towns

                        <p>Since <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName> had established his lead in depicting the market towns of the Low Countries and <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>

                            may well have served as a kind of guidebook for the Ruskins (although of course they could not take a folio volume with them). <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s views would have 
                            persuaded them to adopt a more leisurely and attentive pace through these towns, on the first leg of their Continental tour. 
                            In fact, the route that the Ruskins traced through northern <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> and along the <placeName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</placeName> 
                            in <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName> is strikingly similar to the actual path of <persName corresp="#SP">Prout</persName>&#x02BC;s sketching tour

                                whom he was fortunate to meet or correspond with during his conceptualization and composition of the &#x201C;Account.&#x201D; These contacts became especially important 
                                as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was &#x201C;brought forward&#x201D; as a professional contributor to

                                Two of these men present a striking contrast with one another&#x2014;<ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="rogers_samuel_note.php">Samuel Rogers (1763&#x2013;1855)</ref> and

                            <p>The personae of <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> and <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> each exhibited multiple and even contradictory sides, and the Ruskins must have been selective 
                                about what aspects of these public figures they hoped to cultivate in the patronage of their precocious son. 
                                Respecting <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>, the Ruskins thought of him in his role as the <persName corresp="#JH">Ettrick Shepherd</persName>, who was romantically imagined as having received his call to poetry 
                                when he was shepherd in Ettrick Forest in the <placeName corresp="SCOTTISHBORDERS">Scottish Borders</placeName>, 
                                and who still resided in georgic retirement on his farm in the <geogName corresp="#YARROWVALLEY">Yarrow Valley</geogName>. 
                                The Ruskins would have played down <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s colorful and risqu&#x00E9; character in the &#x201C;Noctes Ambrosianae&#x201D;

                                who imitated the bravado and swagger of these dialogues in their own collaborative and competitive writing, 
                                but <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s parents would hardly have considered such a persona as an appropriate model 
                                for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s solitary and decorous authorship.</p>

                                who surrounded the publishing firms of <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">John Murray</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>. The latter, in particular, as the publisher of

                                who was the first to present <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> with a copy of <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> (probably the <date when="1829">1829</date>

                            <p><persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>, in sharp contrast with <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>, was the urbane &#x201C;man of taste,&#x201D; whose townhouse in <placeName corresp="#STJAMESPLACE">St. James Square</placeName> 
                                was a showplace of exquisitely curated Regency neoclassicism, and the scene of his famous breakfasts in which <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> acted the part of social arbiter 
                                of the current <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> artistic and literary scene. In his most positive light, <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> might have appeared to the Ruskins as a splendid embodiment 
                                of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s tastes and aspirations. A former associate of <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>, and a habitu&#x00E9; of at least the byways of fame, 
                                <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> had earned a sound reputation for his topographical poem, <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>, 
                                which may have paled in comparison to the popular glare of <hi rend="italic">Childe Harold&#x02BC;s Pilgrimage</hi>, 
                                but which was respectably and approachably neoclassical&#x2014;regular in its versification, and grounded in the tradition of the 
                                Grand Tour to <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>. <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> was also, like <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>, a successful businessman, having made his fortune in banking; 
                                and even though he lavished extravagant sums on artists, engravers, and printers in order to satisfy his perfectionism in crafting editions of his poetry, 
                                <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> recouped his huge investment in his illustrated edition of <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> and profited handsomely by its unprecedented sales. 
                                The unattractive side of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> was his notoriously acid wit and his worldliness at a time when middle&#x2010;class Evangelical earnestness 
                                was turning the tide on the influence of Regency &#x201C;men of taste.&#x201D;</p>
                            <p>The two writers also differed profoundly in taste. <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> was so committed to his neoclassicism that <persName corresp="#JMWT">Turner</persName> 
                                reined in his apocalyptic manner typical of his other works of the period in favor of a style that would harmonize with <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s restraint, 
                                by using less dramatic perspective in his vignette designs for <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>

                                The artist whom <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> most admired and hoped to secure as illustrator for his grandest gift book, a deluxe edition of <hi rend="italic">The Queen&#x02BC;s Wake</hi>,

                                Compared to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>, <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> may have seemed hapless in his fortunes: his <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> venture ended in him foolishly mislaying his trust in an under&#x2010;financed publisher, 
                                who went bankrupt and squandered the opportunity to produce a collected edition worthy of the author, whereas <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> boasted the means to encase his writing 
                                in increasing splendor.

                            <p>Despite <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s sentiments, both <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s successes and <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName>&#x02BC;s disappointments were endemic to a period of transition between publishing in the age of 
                                <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName> and the more entrepreneurial and innovative, yet also volatile and confusing print culture 
                                in the age of <persName corresp="#CJHD">Dickens</persName>. In a time when critical discourse commonly bemoaned the decline of poetry in unpropitious circumstances

                                both <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> and <persName corresp="#JH">Hogg</persName> appreciated how poetry could gain new life from its relation with the visual arts&#x2014;a 
                                relation that was rooted in tradition reaching back to the humanist dialogue or <hi rend="italic">paragone</hi> between the sister arts, 
                                yet that was also undergoing renewal and transformation by mass&#x2010;market print technologies. Both men shrewdly exploited the changes in print technology

                                on the beauty of the engravings by which his poems were illustrated,&#x201D; indicating that the youth knew &#x201C;more of the vignettes 
                                [in <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>] than the verses,&#x201D; and the chiding of <persName corresp="#TP">Pringle</persName> &#x201C;that, in future,

                                proves him to have been a boy of his decade, who had so carefully studied the visual culture represented by <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>
