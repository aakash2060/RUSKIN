                <p>Alas, every article of this treaty was strictly ful&#x2013;
                    <lb/>filled with regard to us, and the consequence was,
                    <lb/>that in a six hours ride of twelve miles, I was

                <p>A cathedral is a noble, a beautiful, a sublime

                    <lb/>immensity, of the long aisles, and the faint
                    <lb/>streams of coloured and variegated light, fal&#x2013;
                    <lb/>ling faintly through the Gothic windows,
                    <lb/>streaming at intervals along the chequered

                    <lb/>ces, of the marble figures, giving a ghastly re

                    <lb/>makes you start when you look upon the hollow
