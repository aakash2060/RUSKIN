                    &#x2018;The ocean barrier is beating,&#x2019; 
                    which must be a mis&#x2010;transcription of an insufficiently altered rough copy, now lost, 
                    as the reading is neither rhyme nor reason&#x201D;

                    As a substitution, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> devised his own line, printing it in square brackets, as shown in the <date when="1891">1891</date> witness. 
                    The editors of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.html">Library Edition</ref> disagreed; and in 
                    the <date when="1903">1903</date> witness of &#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem], they restored <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s original line, 
                    arguing that &#x201C;the young author, as we have seen in the case of the <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.html">&#x2018;Iteriad&#x2019;</ref>, 
                    was not always careful to get a true rhyme, and [that] the meaning [of the original line 2 of &#x2018;Calais&#x2019;] is clear enough&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2: 341 n. 2).
                    
                    <lb/>In hypothesizing a &#x201C;rough copy, now lost,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> evidently meant a draft version preceding not only 
                    the MS IX fair&#x2010;copy witness of &#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem], 
                    but also the MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1, witness of &#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem]&#x2014;the 
                    earliest extant version, which is in the hand of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, and which shows interlinear corrections by his son. 
                    In the latter version, line 2 is identical to that in the fair&#x2010;copy version. 
                    That <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was familiar with the 
                        MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1 version, 
                        and was referring to this manuscript as containing the &#x201C;original&#x201D; version of &#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem], 
                    is indicated by his having accepted lines 5&#x2013;6 as originally composed in that version, in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand, 
                    and by his implicitly rejecting <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s revision of those lines in that same MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1 version.
                    The manuscript holding the MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1 version  
                        is presently the sole surviving manuscript source of lines 5&#x2013;6, 
                    which <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> preferred, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> having carried his own, not his father&#x02BC;s, version of these lines to the 
                        MS IX fair copy.
                    
                    <lb/>In arriving at his published version of &#x201C;Calais&#x201D; [poem], <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> appears therefore 
                        to have based his editorial decisions on his own aesthetic judgment, 
                    since his choices overall are consistent neither with the &#x201C;original&#x201D; in <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s hand 
                        nor with the final version in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s, even substituting a line of his own invention where he dislikes both versions. 
                    The editors of the Library Edition, <persName corresp="#ETC">E. T. Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName>, 
                        seem somewhat more consistent 
                        in preferring <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s final, fair&#x2010;copy version, although their decisions are as eclectic and aesthetically driven as 
                        <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s in accepting the latter&#x02BC;s re&#x2010;punctuation of the poem in combination with some punctuation 
                        found in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s fair copy. 
                        <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="AW">Wedderburn</persName> clearly, too, had access to the witnesses 
                        &#x201C;in both the rough and in the fair copy,&#x201D; as they call them&#x2014;meaning, by the &#x201C;rough&#x201D; witness, 
                    what they called <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;father&#x02BC;s copy,&#x201D; 
                        which is the manuscript containing the <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1 version 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2:341 n. 2).
                    
                    <lb/>By <date when="1903">1903</date>, the manuscript containing the <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1 version must have been bound as part of 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="apparatus_msia.html">MS IA</ref>, a compilation that <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="AW">Wedderburn</persName> 
                        added to Collingwood&#x02BC;s list of manuscripts in &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D; 
                        (the &#x201C;Note&#x201D; in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.html">Library Edition</ref> being 
                        &#x201C;revised and completed from the edition of 1891&#x201D;). 
                        This manuscript, at least, would have been included in what the editors identify among the contents of <ref type="apparatus" target="apparatus_msia.html">MS IA</ref>

                    were based on experience. In her journal of the tour, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName></ref> 
                    wrote that, on their first day in <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName>, after settling with customs, 
                    the family toured the cathedral (&#x201C;very beautiful but not so clean as our English churches&#x201D;). 
                    Then she and <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> sketched the sitting room of the hotel where they stayed (which she named, or the diary&#x02BC;s transcriber interpreted, 
                    as &#x201C;L&#x02BC;hotel de Bourbon or Rossignol&#x201D;). 
                    Venturing outside again, the children&#x2014;accompanied by the cicerone, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="salvador_note.php">Salvador</ref>,

                    (&#x201C;a little France, a miniature picture&#x201D;). Similarly, in her journal of the tour, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> (1815&#x2013;49)</ref> 
                    framed a picturesque view: &#x201C;much pleased with the appearance of <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName> from the sea&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</ref>, p. 1). Guidebooks and travel accounts of the period tended to take a more practical view, 
                    portraying the port city in terms of British travelers&#x02BC; complaints about difficulties in negotiating customs and finding lodging; see, for example, 
                    <hi rend="italic">Heath&#x02BC;s Picturesque Annual for <date when="1832">1832</date></hi>, which warns that, in <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName>, 
                    &#x201C;the communication between the strangers and natives is full of strife and wrangling or silent bitterness&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HEATHSANNUAL1832">Ritchie, <hi rend="italic">Travelling Sketches in the North of Italy, the Tyrol, and on the Rhine</hi></ref>, 3). 
                    Whereas <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s account turns the abrupt transition from English character to French, separated only by the <geogName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</geogName> crossing, into a topic for picturesque contrasts of scenery and costume, 
                    <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1836">1836</date> guidebook emphasizes the comforts of familiarity: <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName> &#x201C;is half Anglicised and our language is generally spoken&#x201D;

                        of entering a foreign scene through a city gate in &#x201C;The Lake of Geneva,&#x201C; 
                        the poem that opens <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi>. <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> alludes to <persName corresp="#JJRPHILOSOPHER">Jean&#x2010;Jacques Rousseau</persName>&#x02BC;s (<date notBefore="1712" notAfter="1778">1712&#x2013;78</date>)

                    (MS IA, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.2)&#x2014;Steamers from <geogName corresp="#DOVERCLF">Dover</geogName> to <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName> averaged, according to <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1836">1836</date> guidebook, 
                    two&#x2010;and&#x2010;a&#x2010;half hours for the crossing  
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><hi rend="italic">Hand-book for Travellers on the Continent</hi></ref>, 86). 
                    This was the time required for the Ruskins&#x02BC; crossing, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName> commenting: &#x201C;two hours and a half exactly in crossing and just saved the tide 
                    so that we all landed at the pier, without having recourse to small boats&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</ref>, p. 1). 
                    Unless a return crossing (which is what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;four hours&#x201D; estimates) did require a longer time, 
                    his narrator is mistaken; and in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> version <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                    substituted &#x201C;half an hours&#x02BC;&#x201D; crossing&#x2014;a change that did not improve on the accuracy of &#x201C;four hours,&#x201D; 
                    but that captured the tone he desired for his narrator.
                    
                    <lb/>From the <placeName corresp="#TOWEROFLONDON">Tower of London</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName>, the trip lasted twelve hours,
