                <p>When shall we get up this hill, this interminable hill?<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="cassel_glosses.php#CASSELLSHILLGLOSS"/>  
                    Bend after bend we have been ascending for the last half&#x2010;hour, every successive 
                    turn disclosing a weary length of way, and those tiresome windmills at the top 
                    seem as far from us as ever. Windmills have long been celebrated for gesticulation, 
                    celebrated with Cervantes all over the world,<ref type="gloss_contextual" target="cassel_glosses.php#CERVANTESWINDMILLS"/> but never saw
                    I windmills more provokingly alive than at present, with their long stretchy arms
                    bending to the breeze that flew over the hilltop; they seemed beckoning us up
                    ironically, while the slow measured step of our booted postillion, as he tramped
                    it up the hill as much encumbered as a cat with walnut shells, told us of many a
                    weary moment ere those becks should, could, or would be obeyed. We are on the
                    summit, a green plateau of turf, that looks round on the wide plains of <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>
                    without a single eminence to rival it, and few that can obstruct its view.&#x2014;
                    Fifteen battle&#x2010;fields are in view from that spot, telling a fearful tale of the
                    ready ire of nations, yet looking as green and peaceful as if they had never
                    been watered with blood. They say the cliffs of <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName> are visible from <placeName corresp="#CASSEL">Cassel</placeName>&#x2014;the 
                    sea certainly is, so I looked in the direction and I did see<pb/>
                    something. I had some lurking suspicions it was a cloud, but I chose to believe
                    it was my own <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>, and it did quite as well to bid farewell to.</p>
                <p>I love a view like this, for it seems as if you were looking over all the wide,
                    wide world and were ruling it. Throughout all our after journey I have seen
                    nothing more beautiful or more wonderful of its kind than the view from the
                    little, humble, neglected village of&#x2014;<placeName corresp="#CASSEL">Cassel</placeName>.</p>
