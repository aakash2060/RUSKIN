                <p>Interest in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early works 
                    belongs to a larger <date notBefore="1870" notAfter="1900">fin de si&#x00E8;cle</date> phenomenon in book collecting whereby collectors turned
                    their attention to modern (i.e., <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date>) authors rather than
                    to incunabula and fine typography and illustration, which had preoccupied
                    collectors earlier in the century. Author societies, such as those dedicated to
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <persName corresp="#RB">Robert Browning</persName>, and <persName corresp="#PBS">Percy Shelley</persName>,
                    organized study of every aspect of their authors&#x02BC; lives and works; and
                    supporting this activity, industrious bibliographers, editors, publishers, and
                    booksellers produced reprints and editions of canonical modern authors&#x02BC;
                    works, including juvenilia, along with enumerative or descriptive bibliographies
                    detailing the authors&#x02BC; publications 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#TASTEANDTECHNIQUE">Carter, <title type="book" corresp="#TASTEANDTECHNIQUE" rend="italic">Taste and Technique in Book&#x2010;Collecting</title></ref>, 22).

                    <head type="section">Collectors&#x02BC; &#x201C;Mania&#x201D; for Modern First Editions and Juvenilia, and the Activity of Literary Forgers</head>
                    <p>The aim was to
                        collect a run of an author&#x02BC;s publications that was complete, down to the
                        most minor and fugitive items, and that exhibited each item in its original
                        material condition. These goals led to collectors&#x02BC; competitive search for
                        rare books (causing a rise in market prices). The juvenilia and youthful writing
                        of modern authors&#x2014;what were called <hi rend="italic">early editions</hi>&#x2014;acquired a cachet owing to their extreme scarcity. This
                        goal of comprehensiveness in collecting was controversial, as collectors appeared to place
                        exaggerated value on an author&#x02BC;s minor works. Publishers were suspected of
                        encouraging an interest in juvenilia, since the desire could be met with
                        reprints of works that were out of copyright or appeared to be neglected. Yet, despite these competitive incentives and keenness for the hunt, another
                        significant motivation for collectors&#x02BC; interest in youthful writing lay in a &#x201C;sentiment&#x201D;
                        strongly attached to these early editions in their original condition, and to juvenilia in particular. This sentiment likewise proved fraught and
                        controversial.

                    <p>In historical accounts of the <date notBefore="1880-06-20" notAfter="1901-01-22">late&#x2010;Victorian</date> collecting of modern authors, 
                        the less savory, competitive motivations of collectors were foregrounded, 
                        because these motivations were blamed for creating opportunities for literary forgers. In the overheated rare book market of the last decades of the century, 
                        it was all too easy to fool buyers with spurious editions of lesser known works by prolific <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> authors. Most notoriously, 
                        <persName corresp="#HBF">Henry Buxton Forman</persName> (<date notBefore="1842" notAfter="1917">1842&#x2013;1917</date>) hit upon the

                        heretofore &#x201C;undiscovered&#x201D; publications by modern authors in the
                        single&#x2010;author bibliographies and &#x201C;bio&#x2010;bibliographical&#x201D;
                        essays that catered to the fevered collecting interests of the period. Typically
                        described as small pamphlets, these publications never existed, but the genius
                        of the scam lay in the possibility of their existence, and in the convincingly
                        faked bibliographical descriptions that backed up their alleged histories. With this foundation laid, <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName> and <persName corresp="#HBF">Forman</persName> then
                        arranged for the pamphlets&#x02BC; forgery and their insinuation onto the market 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#COLLINSTWOFORGERS">Collins, <title type="biography" corresp="#COLLINSTWOFORGERS" rend="italic">Two Forgers</title></ref>, 43, 82). A spectacular
                        and daring example of these "creative forgeries" was <persName corresp="#EBB">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</persName>&#x02BC;s alleged private printing 
                        in <date when="1847">1847</date> of the <title type="anthology" corresp="#BROWNINGSONNETS" rend="italic">Sonnets from the Portuguese</title> as a
                        gift for <persName corresp="#RB">Robert</persName>, a story that was fabricated
                        by <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName> and <persName corresp="#HBF">Forman,</persName> and that they followed up with forged physical copies for
                        auction.
                    </p>
                    <p>Modern authors&#x02BC; youthful works proved a ready target for such
                        fabrications, owing to the relative ease of inventing a tale about the origins
                        of a previously little known edition of a juvenile work that was itself obscure. As
                        it turned out, the editors of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php">Library Edition</ref> of Ruskin&#x02BC;s <title type="anthology" corresp="#JRWORKSLE" rend="italic">Works</title>,

                        were among the first to spot these spurious
                        claims. They detected the improbability of the alleged &#x201C;<date when="1868">1868</date>&#x201D; pamphlet of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s
                        juvenile prose tale, <ref type="apparatus" target="leoni_apparatus.php"><title type="prose" corresp="#RUSKINLEONI">&#x201C;Leoni&#x201D;</title></ref>, as well as of the

                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php">Library Edition</ref>&#x02BC;s bibliographical notes on those works.
                        <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>&#x02BC;s doubts apparently went unremarked by many collectors, for the spurious 
                        pamphlets continued to sell, but the editors&#x02BC; alarms helped prompt 
                        <persName corresp="#HGP">Graham Pollard</persName> and <persName corresp="#JC">John Carter</persName> to launch their investigation into questionable

                    <p>Despite the openings for forgery enabled by the fashion for collecting modern &#x201C;firsts,&#x201D; 
                        the interest brought a number of positive scholarly developments, as well, including an
                        interest in juvenilia, and an increased and more systematic attention to
                        the bibliography of <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> books. The relish for first
                        editions&#x2014;which soon became for laymen synonymous with book
                        collecting&#x2014;was not in itself an ambition of earlier
                        <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> collectors. Earlier collectors, insofar as they cared
                        about modern authors at all, had been drawn more to later than to first editions
                        of modern works on the presumed strength of later editions&#x02BC; sounder
                        editing or more lavish production. A boon to scholarly study of the
                        <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> book was particularly afforded by the premium set on
                        original condition of the collectible first edition, a sound rationale that was
                        emphasized by the New Bibliographers of the <date notBefore="1901" notAfter="1930">early twentieth century,</date> such as

                        explain the downfall of <date notBefore="1837-06-20" notAfter="1901-01-22">Victorian</date> collecting. In their view, the fashion for collecting modern firsts could never achieve scholarly method, owing to 
                        a blinding sentimentality that, combined with competitive greed,
                        led to deserved exploitation by sharpers and forgers: &#x201C;As
                        the distance in time between collectors and the object of their enthusiasm
                        lessened [i.e., as collectors turned to moderns instead of
                        incunabula] their interest
                        took on a more personal colour, and the sentimental element became gradually
                        stronger. Collectors were interested in the lives and habits of their favourite
                        authors; they paid more attention to minor productions; they visualised the
                        arrival of the first copies on the author&#x02BC;s breakfast table&#x2014;a

                        With this story of the rise of outmoded biographical sentiment surrounding modern

                        as arriving in their original wrappers on the author&#x02BC;s breakfast table. A
                        secondary implication of this narrative was that collectors had developed an
                        inordinate and ridiculous interest in modern authors&#x02BC; juvenilia, a form of publication that was particularly targeted by <persName corresp="#TJW">Wise</persName> and <persName corresp="#HBF">Forman&#x02BC; forgeries.</persName>

                        collecting characterized a &#x201C;sentiment for the book&#x201D; as a new phenomenon, and
                        the collecting community debated the nature and value of this sentiment along with
                        the goals it sponsored&#x2014;such as the value of acquiring each and every
                        publication by a popular modern author, including &#x201C;minor&#x201D;
                        productions from juvenilia to last words, in order to form a comprehensive
                        collection of that writer (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SENTIMENTANDMATERIALITY">Hanson, <title type="essay" corresp="#SENTIMENTANDMATERIALITY">&#x201C;Sentiment and Materiality in Late&#x2010;Victorian Book Collecting&#x201D;</title></ref>).
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, a popular writer of the <date notBefore="1890" notAfter="1899">1890s</date> on book collecting and a promoter of
                        collecting &#x201C;early editions,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#JHS">J. H. Slater</persName> 
                        (<date when="1854">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1921">1921</date>), used the term <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi> as roughly
                        synonymous with <hi rend="italic">bibliophily</hi> to describe an appreciation
                        for the physical book as distinct, on the one hand, from utilitarian uses of
                        books, and, on the other, from fashionable or eccentric forms of collecting that
                        resulted in mutilation of books (i.e., such practices as
                        extra&#x2010;illustration or cutting out title pages or colophons to form a
                        collection). Thus, <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName> anticipated <persName corresp="#JC">Carter</persName>&#x02BC;s distinction between <hi rend="italic">fashion</hi> 
                        in collecting and proper <hi rend="italic">taste</hi> and <hi rend="italic">technique</hi>, 
                        but he did not automatically consign <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi> to a cause of mere fashion. 
                        For <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName>, sentiment for the book was historically recent, and a phenomenon in need of analysis:
                        &#x201C;Of a truth books have only recently come to be regarded as possessing a
                        sentimental value altogether distinct from considerations of utility&#x201D;
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SLATERROMANCE">Slater, <title type="book" corresp="#SLATERROMANCE" rend="italic">Romance of Book&#x2010;Collecting</title></ref>, 95).
                    </p>
                    <p>The new sentiment was perceived as forming especially around preservation of modern first editions in their original condition. In
                        <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1894">1894</date>

                        which <persName corresp="#JC">Carter</persName> and <persName corresp="#HGP">Pollard</persName>
                        regarded as the &#x201C;primer&#x201D; of the first edition movement 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ENQUIRY"><title type="book" corresp="#ENQUIRY" rend="italic">Enquiry</title></ref>, 103), <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName>
                        speculates why the sentiment for modern authors&#x02BC; early works depended on
                        maintaining the physical copy in its original condition. Such copies, he writes, were likely to have been neglected or destroyed before the
                        author&#x02BC;s fame could bestow special interest on the publications; and
                        thus, when &#x201C;these first&#x2010;fruits, crude though they generally
                        are,&#x201D; come to light along with the rising fame of their author, they gain
                        an appropriate sentimental value, which is only further compounded by their
                        scarcity: &#x201C;the fact that many people want the few copies that have
                        escaped the wrack of neglect, makes them objects of unusual interest. The
                        inevitable reprint comes at last, but it is not the same; sentiment still hangs
                        around the shabby volume of years ago, with all its errors&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EARLYEDITIONS">Slater, <title type="book" corresp="#EARLYEDITIONS" rend="italic">Early Editions</title></ref>, vii).
                    </p>
                    <p>To account for the formation of this sentiment, 
                        <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName> pointed to a number of possible origins. The
                        collecting of modern book illustration, which started earlier in the century,
                        instigated a search for early editions for the sake of sharper,
                        early&#x2010;state impressions of engravings and woodcuts. Another cause of
                        collectors&#x02BC; sentiment for original condition was the interest in tracing textual revisions by favorite modern
                        authors through successive editions&#x2014;a scholarly attraction prompted by a tendency of some 
                        modern writers, such as <persName corresp="#ALT">Tennyson</persName>, to publish successive, revised versions of their work 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EARLYEDITIONS">Slater, <title type="book" corresp="#EARLYEDITIONS" rend="italic">Early Editions</title></ref>, v&#x2013;vii; 
                        see also <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SLATERROMANCE">Slater, <title type="book" corresp="#SLATERROMANCE" rend="italic">Romance of Book&#x2010;Collecting</title></ref>, 118&#x2013;19). In describing the
                        latter motivation, <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName> does reflect a sentimentality in <persName corresp="#JC">Carter</persName> and
                        <persName corresp="#HGP">Pollard</persName>&#x02BC;s sense of the collector&#x02BC;s imaginary closeness to the life
                        of a favorite author. Dramatizing the appeal of the first edition, <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName> evokes a
                        &#x201C;personal connection&#x201D; with the author: &#x201C;It may be assumed
                        that the author has in the vast majority of cases seen and handled the book for
                        which he was himself responsible; the very copy we hold in our hand may have
                        belonged to him.&#x201D; Despite such over&#x2010;dramatization, <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName>&#x02BC;s
                        idea of a sentiment driving a nascient textual criticism of modern literature is
                        legitimately scholarly, and not merely nostalgic: first
                        editions, he argues, supply the possibility of tracing &#x201C;the working of the
                        author&#x02BC;s mind by a comparison of the wording of one edition with that of
                        another,&#x201D; and of understanding &#x201C;why [the author] made the
                        alterations&#x201D; and even &#x201C;enter[ing] into [the
                        author&#x02BC;s] thoughts, and perhaps . . . appreciat[ing] his feelings&#x201D; about such revisions
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SLATERHOWTOCOLLECT">Slater, <title type="book" corresp="#SLATERHOWTOCOLLECT" rend="italic">How to Collect Books</title></ref> 182).
                    </p>
                    <p>This sentiment for early editions, along with the perception of the sentiment as
                        a phenomenon of recent date, was not in itself controversial, although <persName corresp="#JC">Carter</persName> and <persName corresp="#HGP">Pollard</persName> present the movement two&#x2010;dimensionally, 
                        with opponents and supporters ranged on either side of a monolithic issue, as the besotted public went on purchasing heedlessly. 
                        In fact, <persName corresp="#WR">William Roberts</persName>, while 
                        continuing to berate the &#x201C;cult&#x201D; surrounding firsts, confessed to sharing an
                        appreciation of the &#x201C;charm [that] is so much a matter of feeling&#x201D; in the
                        &#x201C;attraction of a first edition&#x201D; (or so he conceded, at least, 
                        in the moderated language with which he toned down his <title type="periodical" corresp="#FORTNIGHTLYREVIEW" rend="italic">Fortnightly</title> essays when collected in book form). 
                        He goes on: Even if one puts aside the features of a preserved 
                        first edition that, to a bibliographer, are &#x201C;much more than sentimental&#x201D; (e.g.,
                        the survival for posterity of papers, typefaces, and bindings that have fallen
                        out of fashion), the appeal of an early edition &#x201C;falls into the category of
                        things which are not explainable&#x201D; to &#x201C;the utilitarian.&#x201D; The shabby volume is
                        &#x201C;esteemed as bringing our sons or grandsons nearer than any amount of written
                        description to our own &#x2018;old&#x2014; times.&#x201D; The pleasure is &#x201C;spiritual&#x201D; and the
                        &#x201C;experience . . . a thing of feeling and not of argument&#x201D;

                    </p>
                    <p>In this lively competition among collectors to make their modern author
                        collections comprehensive, the controversy arose in part, as <persName corresp="#FWH">Halsey</persName> suggests, from a perceived
                        distortion of pricing in the market for rarities. For <persName corresp="#WR">William Roberts,</persName> excessive value
                        was placed on copies of minor publications as compared with canonical works:
                        &#x201C;Where a collector desires to have a complete series of the works written by the
                        author or authors to whom he devotes his attention,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#WR">Roberts</persName> remarked, a handful of
                        first editions took on a disproportionate value merely because &#x201C;they are
                        exceedingly rare, and . . . that is about as much as can be urged in their
                        favour.&#x201D; In the case of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin,</persName> for example, the value of first editions of the
                        major works had declined in the market, while &#x201C;the publications of Mr. Ruskin
                        which more than maintain their commercial value are those which are quite
                        unknown except to the specialist. They are little pamphlets and tracts, which
                        were, for the most part, printed in exceedingly small numbers, and are now
                        practically unprocurable. Although there are about a dozen collectors who have
                        spared neither time nor money to render their Ruskiniana complete, we believe
                        that not more than one can claim to have an absolutely final series of the works
                        of the &#x2018;master.&#x2019; A rough calculation places the value of a complete set of
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> at not much short of &#x00A3;300 for about sixty distinct publications&#x201D;

                    <p>It is clear that, for detractors, juvenilia ranked high in the list of these

                        collections at the fin de si&#x00E8;cle, certain modern juvenilia are repeatedly singled out as holding a

                        is, it should be &#x201C;valued not so much on account of its intrinsic merit as for
                        the circumstances attending its production, the personality of the writer, and
                        its excessive rarity&#x201D;

                    <p>Whereas the comprehensive single&#x2013;author collection that highlighted such items

                        editions by their market value rather than by their solely bibliographical

                        From his standpoint as a &#x201C;complete bibliographer,&#x201D;
                        &#x201C;the bibliographical importance of one book by any particular author is
                        as great as the bibliographical importance of any other book by the same writer.
                        Each book marks a stage in the growth or decadence of the writer&#x02BC;s

                        &#x201C;ana&#x201D; volumes constructing a biographical narrative using selected earlier

                        Because <persName corresp="#EBB">Barrett Browning</persName>&#x02BC;s juvenile publications were out of copyright,

                        This declaration by <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> of the significance of juvenilia in a writer's development,

                        such publication should be regulated, like the young author himself or herself, in order to &#x201C;discharge&#x201D; as much &#x201C;nonsense&#x201D;

                    <p>In <date when="1879-06">June 1879</date>, <persName corresp="#RHS">Richard Herne Shepherd</persName> pressed a libel suit against the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ATHENAEUM" rend="italic">Athenaeum</title> 
                        for accusing him of dishonesty and vampirism, among other slanders. <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> won his case, securing &#x00A3;150 in damages, 
                        not long after <persName corresp="#JAMW">James McNeill Whistler</persName> achieved a merely Pyrrhic victory of a farthing&#x02BC;s worth of damages 
                        in his <date when="1878-11">November 1878</date> libel trial against <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>. Both libel suits were concerned at a fundamental level 
                        with questions of artistic or literary value and the authority for determining such value and holding public sway over such determinations. The issues never arose between 
                        between <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> or the 
                        <orgName corresp="#BRANTWOODCI">Brantwood Circle</orgName>, because <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> never attempted to reprint works by 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, and so a more straightforward violation of intellectual property never brought forward the grander issues of artistic value 
                        and authority. (The true property thief, <persName corresp="#TJW">T. J. Wise</persName>, meanwhile went undetected. In <date when="1934">1934</date>, 
                        when he was finally accused of forgery, Wise tried to pin the crime on <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName>; and both he and <persName corresp="#HBF">Forman</persName>

                        The emphasis of the prospectus was in keeping with collectors&#x02BC; sentiment for modern firsts in original condition, and with readers&#x02BC; interest
