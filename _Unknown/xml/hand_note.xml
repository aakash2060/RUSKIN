                <p>The earliest extant sustained writing by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears in 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref> and 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msiva_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIVA">MS IVA</title></ref>, dated 1826&#x2013;27, which
                    he wrote entirely in print lettering. The medium is graphite, for which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> probably would have used a porte&#x2010;crayon&#x2014;a metal holder for rods of plumbago&#x2014;or 
                    he might have used a cedar pencil. The plumbago used in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> was proudly mined in <placeName corresp="#BORROWDALE">Borrowdale</placeName>, 
                    where high quality deposits were carefully husbanded 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FINLAYWESTERNWRITINGIMPLEMENTS">Finlay, <hi rend="italic">Western Writing Implements</hi></ref>, 52&#x2013;53). 
                    The porte&#x2010;crayon is a typical object in eighteenth&#x2010;century genre paintings showing boys absorbed in drawing, 
                    such as works by the French artists <persName corresp="#JSC">Jean Sim&#x00E9;on Chardin</persName> (1699&#x2013;1779), 
                    <persName corresp="#JBG">Jean&#x2010;Baptiste Greuze</persName> (1725&#x2013;1805), and Nicolas&#x2010;Bernard L&#x00E9;pici&#x00E9; (1735&#x2013;84),
                    who were concerned with conveying progressive educational ideas and with representing children as thoughtful, individualistic observers 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JOHNSONPICTURINGPEDAGOGY">Johnson, &#x201C;Picturing Pedagogy&#x201D;</ref>).
                </p>
                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> based his print lettering in part on models found in his favorite books. For example, in his adaptation of 
                    <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s <title corresp="#EDGEWORTHEARLYLESSONS">Early Lessons</title>, 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</ref>, 
                    he imitated the original&#x02BC;s title page; and his lettering generally suggests the influence of English transitional serif typefaces, such as Baskerville and Bulmer,  
                    and their predecessor, Caslon, which predominated in British books of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. 
                    Even in these first manuscripts, the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref>, however, 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> also flourished his lettering with decorative capitals that 
                    in the 1828&#x2013;29 <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol3_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#HARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 3</title></ref>, 
                    he called &#x201C;double&#x201D; print. 
                    The style of this lettering appears based on the sanserif typefaces that began as a neoclassical revival in the 1780s 
                    and sprang into a variety of forms and associations in the first decades of the nineteenth century 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC">Cramsie, <title corresp="#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC"><hi rend="italic">Story of Graphic Design</hi></title></ref>, 117&#x2013;18, 126&#x2013;27). 
                    One likely model for his &#x201C;double&#x201D; lettering was the largest, most prominent labeling used for maps in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s geography book, 
                    <title type="map" corresp="#GOLDSMITHGEOGRAPHY"><hi rend="italic">Geography Illustrated on a Popular Plan</hi></title> by the <persName corresp="#RJG">Rev. J. Goldsmith</persName> (<date when="1820">1820</date>). 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <title type="collected_works" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 35:79)</p>
                <p>According to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first used pen and ink around <date when="1827-04-28">28 April 1827</date> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <title type="collected_letters" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 156;

                    These fledgling efforts with pen and ink are best exhibited in <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="MSIII">MS III</title></ref>. Its inside
                    back endboard is covered with random words and letters in ink, as if <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was
                    practicing use of his pen. In that same year, when entering the first works to be fair&#x2010;copied in 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>&#x2014;that is,

                    traced his letters in ink over top of his initial pencil lettering, 
                    which remains visible beneath. (A clearly visible example of the procedure is found in line 1 of 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="spring_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#SPRINGBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Spring: Blank Verse&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                    where <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> left the terminal <hi rend="italic">s</hi> 
                    of the word <hi rend="italic">beauties</hi> in pencil, forgetting to overwrite that one letter in ink.) 
                    Also, the drawings for this <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Book</ref> are in pencil, while 
                    their legends written in ink. A similar mix occurs in a <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> letter to his father, 
                    the text of which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote in pencil, but which included two poems fair&#x2010;copied in ink,

                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>, he had perfected a tiny ink lettering, free of

                    which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> lettered in pencil in the &#x201C;feb / march 1827&#x201D; version, 
                    and in ink in the <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref> version</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> probably learned to write in ink using a quill, if trade statistics for the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> 
                    provide a reliable guide. In <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> alone, imported goose quills consumed annually averaged around 20 million, 
                    and the country as a whole used about double that number. However, the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName> 
                    also witnessed the mass production of steel pens, and by <date when="1838">1838</date> this output increased to 220 million. Also by the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, 
                    manufacturers were perfecting quill nibs for use in pen holders, 
                    and improvements in quill fountain&#x2010;pens were being patented. These alternatives to the traditional quill became more affordable and widely used in the 
                    <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. Quills of any kind were purchased already prepared or &#x201C;dressed&#x201D;; and as the huge consumption suggests, 
                    consumers typically were unskilled in mending a quill for extended use, or unwilling to take the trouble, 
                    preferring merely to discard a dull pen for a fresh one

                    <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName> held the post of writing master and accountant at the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Royal High School</orgName>, <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName>, 
                    until <date when="1793">1793</date>, 
                    shortly before <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> enrolled at that institution in <date when="1795">1795</date>. At age ten, 
                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> was already somewhat older than his class, 
                    the customary starting age at the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">High School</orgName> being eight. (While the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">High School</orgName> was fiercely republican 
                    in seating tradesmen&#x02BC;s sons alongside those of patricians, 
                    the Ruskin family probably needed extra time to scrape together money for the fees, or they may have been apprehensive of exposing <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> to a famously sadistic Latin master 
                    [see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SCOTTISHHERITAGE">Viljoen, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Scottish Heritage</hi></ref>, 59&#x2013;62].) 
                    Given his own delayed matriculation, whatever its cause, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> perhaps acted with deliberate resolve in introducing his son in <date when="1827">1827</date>, at age eight, 
                    to copybook exercises by his alma mater&#x02BC;s writing master. By this age, in 1826&#x2013;27 John had already begun practicing (in pencil)

                    for five to six years in Latin lessons (and some Greek in the fifth year) as a foundation for entry to the universities, where at age thirteen or fourteen they began training 
                    for professions, most often for the law (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SCOTTISHHERITAGE">Viljoen, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Scottish Heritage</hi></ref>, 59&#x2013;61).

                    Instead, his departure in <date when="1802">1802</date> for a mercantile life in <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> compelled him to pursue self&#x2010;culture, 
                    which both his own determination and the intensifying print and visual culture of the era 
                    enabled him to support, first for himself and then for his family.</p>
                <p>Copybooks like <persName corresp="#EBD">Butterworth</persName>&#x02BC;s were designed to straddle the worlds of public instruction in schools and of private instruction in the home, whether by writing masters or by self&#x2010;guided practice. 
                    Even at the <orgName corresp="#RHSE">Edinburgh High School</orgName>, the writing and arithmetic classes had always been optional, the expectation being that many youths would acquire these accomplishments 
                    on their own by various means (see <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="butterworth_e_note.php"><persName corresp="#EDB">Edmund Butterworth</persName> (d. 1814)</ref>). 
                    In an <date when="1825">1825</date> advertisement, the publisher <orgName corresp="#OANDB">Oliver &#x0026; Boyd</orgName> of <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName> characterizes

                    as &#x201C;designed for the Use of Schools and Private Families,&#x201D; by &#x201C;combining accurate Writing, correct Figures, and judicious Arrangement.&#x201D; 
                    Of the five productions by <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName> listed, the advertisement goes on to declare that &#x201C;[f]or beauty of design, and correctness of execution, 
                    these Works of Mr <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName> are admired by every competent judge of Penmanship.

                    They are the productions of an indefatigable genius in his profession, exercised and improved by the experience of above forty years.&#x2014;The

                <p>As a path to self&#x2010;cultivation, copybooks typically provided instructional texts (set in letterpress) along with illustrations of writing samples in various styles or &#x201C;hands&#x201D; 
                    (reproduced from engraving or woodcut and, later, from lithograph). Subcategories of copybooks specialized in particular disciplines or audiences, 
                    such as youths or ladies (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BECKERPRACTICEOFLETTERS">Becker, <title corresp="#BECKERPRACTICEOFLETTERS"><hi rend="italic">Practice of Letters</hi></title></ref>, xi). 
                    Most copybooks modeled the formal script known as <hi rend="italic">English round hand</hi> or <hi rend="italic">copperplate</hi>, 
                    which in the eighteenth century had settled into a practical but elegant script that was less elaborate than earlier versions, and that was widely used in business. 
                    An influential standard for English round hand was set by the copybook, <title rend="italic" type="book" corresp="#BICKHAMUNIVERSALPENMAN">Universal Penman</title> (1733&#x2013;41), 
                    jointly authored by the engraver and writing master, <persName corresp="#GBE">George Bickham</persName> (1684&#x2013;1758), and his son. Practiced using a pen with a flexible quill nib, 
                    round hand called for a looping style that accentuated contrasts of thin and thick strokes, a style related to the late&#x2010;eighteenth&#x2010;century transitional and modern typefaces 
                    that featured these extreme contrasts, such as Baskerville and Bodoni 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC">Cramsie, <title corresp="#CRAMSIEGRAPHIC"><hi rend="italic">Story of Graphic Design</hi></title></ref>, 119&#x2013;21). 
                    In the view of a historian of calligraphy, the common English round hand was &#x201C;colourless, thoroughly unromantic, and dull&#x201D;; however, these &#x201C;were precisely 
                    the qualities which commended [the hand] to those who wrote our invoices and to those abroad who received then&#x201D;; and this &#x201C;plain hand for a plain purpose&#x201D; 
                    was typified in the nineteenth century by &#x201C;the books of <persName corresp="#EDB">Butterworth</persName>,&#x201D; in which the hand became &#x201C;even more matter&#x2010;of&#x2010;fact and more standardised&#x201D;
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MORISONDEVELOPMENTOFHANDWRITING">Morison, &#x201C;Development of Hand&#x2010;Writing&#x201D;</ref>, xxxiii, xl).

                <p>While round hand developed as a business script, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s early cursive hand more closely resembles the hand of his mother than that of his father, 
                    which is flamboyantly larger, more slanted, and extends long ascenders and descenders. (The contrast is vivid in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, <hi rend="italic">g</hi>.1, version of 
                    <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msia_g1.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#RUSKINACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title></ref>, to which both <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> and <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> contributed 
                    fair copy.) It makes sense, however, that a home&#x2010;schooled youth would imitate his mother&#x02BC;s hand, particularly in a household like the Ruskins&#x02BC;, 
                    from which the father was absent for protracted periods. When learning to handle pen and ink, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> declared, according to his mother, 
                    &#x201C;that the thoughts of your [<persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s] being pleased encourages him,&#x201D; and <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> believed that &#x201C;the showing you his writing occupied his thoughts 
                    fully more than how he expressed his feelings&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <title type="collected_letters" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>, 156&#x2013;57); 
                    nevertheless, it was <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> who was at hand teaching him to write. 
                    Examples of these first efforts from around <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date> include <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> letter accompanying 
                    <ref type="witness" target="wales_houghton.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#WALES">&#x201C;Wales&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                    (not the poem itself, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> copied in print lettering rather than cursive, albeit using a pen). An early example of cursive applied to a poem is found in 
                    <ref type="witness" target="constellations_msrft70.php">&#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#THECONSTELLATIONS">The Constellations: Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern</title>&#x201D;</ref> in its RF T70 version. 
                    This version certainly predated the late 1827&#x2013;early 1828 <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy of the poem, albeit perhaps not by very long, and the hand is very awkward, but recognizably <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s; 
                    and the script appears to be in ink, although the medium can no longer be proven, since the RF T70 survives only as a photograph, so far as is known. 
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mastery of a copperplate hand is witnessed by <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#RUSKINACCOUNTTOUR">Account of a Tour on the Continent</title></ref> 
                    in his impressive <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIX">MS IX</title> fair copy.</p>
