                    that it was breakfast time just as she got<lb/> 
                    to the northern crown. After breakfast<lb/>

                    breakfast. Harry today got as far in his
                    map as dividing the shires and naming-
                    them as Cornwall Devon Dorset &#x0026; he-
                    got to the tenth pastoral after dinner and then 
                    finished dividing and naming the shires
                    Harry was drawing some very beautiful 
                    trees that were in a book of his and his 
                    father said that it was the best piece of 
                    drawing that he had ever done.
                <p>
                    Harry and Lucy were so fond of Don Quix
                    ote that they were quite disappointed when 
                    they missed it but they did not miss it that-
                    night for they had a good deal of it. In-
                    the morning Lucy learned the follow-
                    ing constellations.

                    After Lucy had finished these they went down to 
                    breakfast and when harry had done his lessons
                    he coloured his map and began to do the names
                    and rivers. This day he finished the pastorals
                    and did some more of the names and rivers
                    In the evening they got on a good deal with Don
                    Quixote after which Harry went to bed.
                    And in the morning Lucy learned these-
                    constellations

                   And then went to breakfast

                <p>
                    After Harry had learned his lessons he went 
                    to a poem that he was composing for his father on 
                    new years day <!-- new years day looks as if it is written as one word --> as he always presented him with-
                    a poem at that period. The subject of it was
                    a battle between the Pretender or Chevalier-
                    as Harry would have him called and the for-
                    ces or part of the forces of George the 3rd
                    All the poems which he had not yet given-
                    to his father were in what Harry called-
                    single print but he was printing this double
                    in this manner m <!-- this m is written in a differnt font by young Ruskin--> and it was most beauti
                    fully done you may be sure. It was irr
                    egualr measure. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Harry when he had done what he thought
                    a moderate allowance of his poem went to-
                    his map But scarcely had the pen touched 
                    the paper when in came dinner however

                    <fw type="pageNum" place="top-left">8</fw>
                    that hindrance was soon over and Harry return
                    ed to his map. He today nearly finished it &#x0026;
                    after having had some of Don Quixote he went-
                    to bed."
                <p>
                    But whenever the world was left To darkness and 
                    to me, a bright thought came into harry's mind-
                    Harrys <!-- Illegible word, thoind?--> that if he could contrive to make a-
                    Punches show or rather fantoccini out of paper he could-
                    exhibit it when he presented his poem and please
                    his father a little more so he fell to work to plan-
                    one. First he settle the size which was to be a-
                    about five inches long to bread and two side-
                    ways. The top where the figures were to act was
                    to be 2 inches square.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This settle Harry began to think how he-
                    should make it Harry first s<add rend="overwriting">t</add>hought what shape the-
                    piece of paper must be before it was put tog
                    ether so as to form the show After he had-
                    altered a good deal he found that it must be
                    of this shape <!-- Block shapes drawn here labelled A-F --> with margins for join-
                    ing The piece marked A formed one of the 
                    sides, that B the front of the show C was to be

                    bent back and with a small slit in it formed
                    the bottom of the pace where the figures were 
                    to act D the top of the show E the other 
                    side and F the back so that the whole
                    show when put together was like this <!-- another blocked figure -->
