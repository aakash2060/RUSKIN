                <p>The archive <hi rend="italic">Early Ruskin Manuscripts</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>)
                    contains, at the most fundamental level, two sets of edited primary materials: 
                    <hi rend="italic">works</hi> and <hi rend="italic">manuscripts</hi>.</p>
                    <list>
                        <item>A <hi rend="italic">work</hi> in this edition consists of a discrete text 
                            by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> (e.g., a poem, an essay, a 
                            sermon, a mathematical proof), including all available witnesses of that 
                            text (each of these edited and annotated), and accompanied by the 
                            work&#x02BC;s explanatory apparatus and available facsimiles.</item>
                        <item>A <hi rend="italic">manuscript</hi> is a physical document manifesting 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s texts, 
                            represented in the archive by its own explanatory apparatus in addition to 
                            the <hi rend="italic">works</hi> that make up the manuscript.</item>
                    </list>
                <p>Organizationally, the archive turns on these basic units, 
                    as represented by a given work&#x02BC;s <ref type="internal" target="#WORKSPAGES">Work Pages</ref> 
                    and by a given manuscript&#x02BC;s <ref type="internal" target="#MANUSCRIPTPAGES">Manuscript Pages</ref>. 
                    The fundamental relation between these two kinds of units is the manuscript as container and the work as contained. 
                    For <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, however, the separate integrity of these units often creates a creative tension, 
                    which the archive aims to preserve through its editorial methodology (see 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="editorial_rationale_note.php">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology)</ref>.</p>
                <p><ref type="internal" target="#WORKSPAGES">Work Pages</ref> and <ref type="internal" target="#MANUSCRIPTPAGES">Manuscript Pages</ref> consist respectively 
                    of consistent sets of XML/TEI documents, discussed below. At a global level, the archive also contains editorial 
                    materials&#x2014;<ref type="internal" target="#NOTES">Notes</ref>, <ref type="internal" target="#ESSAYS">Essays</ref>, and 
                    <ref type="internal" target="#BIBLIOGRAPHY">Bibliography</ref>&#x2014;that are not anchored to particular works or manuscripts, 
                    but serve as universally accessible resources, and that are indexed at the same level as works and manuscripts. 
                    These materials, like the various <ref type="internal" target="#WORKSPAGES">Work Pages</ref> and <ref type="internal" target="#MANUSCRIPTPAGES">Manuscript Pages</ref>, each open on a separate 
                    tab in the user's browser.

                    <p>Facsimile views, in the case of bound manuscripts, open to the page(s) containing the chosen witness of the work. In most cases, this view will appear as a

                        the facsimile view is often similar to a two&#x2010;page spread. Loose single-sheet manuscripts are shown one side per view, recto followed by verso.</p>

                    <p>The Manuscript Apparatus Page is the default destination for any hyperlinked occurrence of a manuscript title, whether accessed through the indices, Works Pages, or various forms of commentary. 
                        The page is headed by the manuscript&#x02BC;s editorial title, as governed by rules given in the 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="title_citation_for_major_mss_note.php">System of Title Citation for Major Manuscripts</ref>.</p>
                    <p>The Apparatus is a single page consisting of seven sections: Title, Location, Provenance, Description, Contents, Discussion.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Title</hi> declares the editorial title, and goes on to discuss the history of entitling the manuscript, including <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s
                                own title, if any, and his editors&#x02BC; titles.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Location</hi> identifies where the manuscript is currently held, along with any helpful cataloging information.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Provenance</hi> describes the history of ownership and transmission. For many manuscripts, which share a common provenance with others, this section consists simply of a
                                link to the appropriate section of the long note on <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_note.php">Provenance</ref>. For some manuscripts, however, the Apparatus
                                requires this section in order to elaborate on a unique history.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Description</hi> supplies physical characteristics, such as size, color, and kind of binding materials. The description also include what in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> is
                                termed a <hi rend="italic">Collation</hi>. Rather than an account of the assemblage of signatures in a printed book, however, <hi rend="italic">collation</hi> here refers to
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s (and, sometimes, his and/or others&#x02BC;) pagination. This pagination applies either to an originally blank, bound notebook or of a bound
                                compilation of originally separate leaves. In the case of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own page numbering, collations must often take account of the misnumbering of
                                pages and of missing pages. The collation provides the basis for a somewhat more speculative reconstruction of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s patterns of use of the manuscript,
                                a narrative reserved for the Discussion. Page references in the collation list are active, capable of opening the corresponding Manuscript Facsimile views. In some cases, descriptions of a
                                manuscript&#x02BC;s cover and endpapers contain active links to facsimile views, as well.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Contents</hi> lists sequentially the works contained in the manuscript. The titles in the list are active, hyperlinked to their respective Work Apparatus Page.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Date</hi> gives the inclusive dates for use of the manuscript by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and sometimes by others.</item>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Discussion</hi>, like the corresponding section in a Work Apparatus, is a catch&#x2010;all for topics that cannot be accommodated in other sections. For example,
                                one frequently recurring topic placed here is an attempt to reconstruct <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s palimpsest&#x2010;like uses and reuses of an originally bound manuscript.
                                These reconstructions propose sequences of composition rarely corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">sequential</hi> list given in the Contents, which describes the physical order of a
                                manuscript&#x02BC;s contents: <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> seldom worked straightforwardly from beginning to end of a notebook. Other topics taken up in this section include
                                discussion of the hand(s) characterizing the manuscript, its relation to similar manuscripts, and so on.</item>
