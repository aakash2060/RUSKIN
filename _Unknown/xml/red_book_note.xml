                <head type="title">Red Book</head>
                <p>The term by which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and his parents referred to store&#x2010;bought stationer&#x02BC;s notebooks with reddish&#x2010;brown,
                    flexible leather covers (described specifically as <hi rend="italic">roan</hi> in Sotheby &#x0026; Co., <title type="catalog_auction" corresp="#SOTHEBYCAT1930" rend="italic">Catalogue of the Manuscripts and Remaining Library of John Ruskin</title> [1930], 20&#x2013;21), 
                    each approximately 15 centimeters tall by 10 centimeters wide. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and <persName corresp="#JJR">his father</persName> exchange the term in referring, for example, 
                    to <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref> (letter of <date when="1829-03-10">10 March 1829</date>, in 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL" rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</title></ref>, 192), and presumably extended the term 
                    to all the (presently known and extant) notebooks resembling it: that is,
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>, 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msiiia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIIIA">MS IIIA</title></ref>, 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msiv_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIV">MS IV</title></ref>,

                    <ref type="apparatus" target="juvenilia_b.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JUVMSB">Juvenilia MS B</title></ref>, and
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="juvenilia_c.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JUVMSC">Juvenilia MS C</title></ref>.</p>
                <p>Judging by references to the Red Books in family letters, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> composed in these notebooks mainly at home, although their contents 
                    suggest that he may occasionally have carried some of them on family travels through <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#WALES">Wales</placeName>, 
                    and <placeName corresp="#NBRITAIN">North Britain</placeName>. Certainly, he used the Red Books to reflect on travel, as in his small anthologies of topographical verse, 
                    such as <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;Poetry Discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="juvenilia_c.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#JUVMSC">Juvenilia MS C</title></ref> served the family as his imitation of a travel guidebook, 
                    containing the <ref type="apparatus" target="travel_itinerary_and_tour_notes_1828.php"><title type="essay" corresp="#JRTRAVELITINERARY1828">Travel Itinerary and Tour Notes [1828]</title></ref> 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tours_of_1826-27_note.php">Tours of 1826&#x2013;27</ref>).</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">Red Book</hi> was perhaps a family jest. According to the <title type="dictionary" corresp="#OED"><hi rend="italic">OED</hi></title>, 
                    the term applies to &#x201C;official books, usually distinguished by having a red binding, of political, administrative, or economic significance,&#x201D; 
                    a usage current since the fifteenth century (&#x201C;red book, n.1,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">OED Online</hi>, accessed <date when="2015-12-30">30 December 2015</date>), 
                    although, for the Ruskins, the term may have referred merely to the color. In later years, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> may also have intended these 
                    notebooks when using the term <hi rend="italic">Little Book</hi> for manuscripts containing juvenilia composed by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> up to age ten&#x2014;a 
                    description that matches the Red Books accurately enough, since it was starting at about that age, in <date notBefore="1829" notAfter="1830">1829&#x2013;30</date>, 
                    when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> put aside the Red Books for larger, ledger&#x2010;like, half&#x2010;calf notebooks, some of which he dedicated solely to rough draft, 
                    and others solely to fair copy (although for a few years after <date when="1829">1829</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did continue to exploit the Red Books for left&#x2010;over blank spaces 
                    in which to rough&#x2010;draft poetry and prose). (See letters of <date when="1850-02-01">1 February 1850</date> [MSL 002/003/096] and <date when="1850-02-02">2 February 1850</date> [MSL 002/003/097], 
                    in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MSL002-003">Letters from <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> to <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName>, 1829&#x2013;1862</ref>, 
                    both letters also quoted in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENPOEMS1850">Dearden, &#x201C;Production and Distribution of <persName corresp="#JR">John Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> 1850&#x201D;</ref>, 156&#x2013;57. 
                    It is possible, however, that <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s usage of <hi rend="italic">Little Book</hi> refers, not to a Red Book, but to 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msv_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title></ref>, a small half&#x2010;calf notebook that

                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">Red Book</hi> stuck throughout <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s life. As late as <date when="1891">1891</date>, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName></ref> employed the term in

                    Describing <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title> as a &#x201C;ruled note&#x2010;book, bound in
                    red leather,&#x201D; roughly 6 by 4 inches, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> goes on to use the term <hi rend="italic">Red Book</hi> 
                    as a shorthand to designate <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> and <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIV">MS IV</title> as
                    conforming with this description (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1:262;

                <p>On <date when="1870-09-08">8 September 1870</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> remembered the term when docketing 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msiv_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIV">MS IV</title></ref> as
                    &#x201C;Red book No. 1,&#x201D; <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref> as 
                    &#x201C;Red book No. 2,&#x201D; and <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref> as 
                    &#x201C;Red book No. 3.&#x201D; What prodded his selection and arrangement of these three of the seven Red Books is unrecorded,
                    but there are clues to his motives. On <date when="1870-08-09">9 August</date>, he had visited <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="herne_hill_note.php"><placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName></ref>,
                    where he &#x201C;put all in order,&#x201D; confiding to his diary that he &#x201C;worked once more in that old house, going through the room where
                    I lay in the morning looking at my first watercolour painting,&#x201D; and one wonders whether he found his juvenilia there, or whether the old
                    associations prompted him to unearth the Red Books on return to <placeName corresp="#DENMARKHL">Denmark Hill</placeName>. The diary entry for <date when="1870-09-08">8 September</date> remarks only on the bad weather, but, on the
                    following Sunday (<date when="1870-09-11">11 September</date>), <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> looks back on a depressing week (&#x201C;for many a year&#x201D; not one &#x201C;so
                    miserable&#x201D;), during which he &#x201C;put much into order&#x201D; and &#x201C;read old poems of <date when="1848">1848</date>&#x201D;:
                    &#x201C;I have gained something in  <date notBefore="1848" notAfter="1870">these twenty&#x2010;two years</date>,&#x201D; he pronounced

                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s reasons are also obscure for having chosen these particular Red Books to number, and for numbering them in this order. 
                    Curiously, he numbered them in reverse chronological order. &#x201C;No. 1,&#x201D; <ref type="apparatus" target="msiv_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIV">MS IV</title></ref>,

                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>, contains dates in his and his 
                    <persName corresp="#MR">his mother</persName>&#x02BC;s hands ranging from <date when="1826">1826</date> to <date when="1829">1829</date>; and &#x201C;No. 3,&#x201D; 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>, is dated <date notBefore="1826" notAfter="1827">1826&#x2013;27</date> 
                    in his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName>&#x02BC;s hand (see <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php#DATE"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title>: Date</ref>,

                    and <ref type="apparatus" target="msiv_apparatus.php#DATE"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIV">MS IV</title>: Date</ref>). 
                    Perhaps he gave first place to <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIV">MS IV</title> because its chief work is the botanical poem, &#x201C;on the universe,&#x201D; 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="eudosia_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201C;Eudosia&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                    for which had two possible reasons in <date when="1870">1870</date> to assign priority: his preference at this time to emphasize his boyhood talents for natural history; and obscure symbolic 
                    connections with <persName corresp="#RLT">Rose La Touche (1848&#x2013;75)</persName>.</p>
                <p>In <date when="1869">1869</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had mined <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref> 
                    for the boyhood poem <ref type="apparatus" target="glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glenfarg&#x201D; and &#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Papa how pretty those icicles are&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                    which he reprinted in <title type="book" corresp="JRQUEENAIR">The Queen of the Air</title> as an illustration of his &#x201C;birthright&#x201D; of &#x201C;art&#x2010;gift&#x201D; 
                    that came to him &#x201C;by Athena&#x02BC;s will, from the air of English country villages, and Scottish hills&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 19:396&#x2013;97, and see 283). 
                    In <date when="1869-09">September 1869</date>, <persName corresp="#RLT">Rose</persName> sent him a cryptic message, 
                    by returning her copy of the book, enclosing only a weed and a rose leaf between its pages. An accidental face&#x2010;to&#x2010;face meeting between <persName corresp="#RLT">Rose</persName> 
                    and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in <date when="1870-01">January 1870</date> only deepened the enigma and tension of their relations, 
                    and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> began compiling notes for a book that would become his own contribution to the &#x201C;language of the flowers,&#x201D; 
                    <title type="book" corresp="#JRPROSERPINA">Proserpina</title>. Their conflicted and rebarbative exchange continued throughout the year; however, a letter from <persName corresp="#RLT">Rose</persName> 
                    gave <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> hope, and in <date when="1870-09">September 1870</date>, when he annotated the Red Books, he sought counsel to prepare a statement 
                    defining his legal, moral, and sexual status regarding his marriage&#x2014;a document that would later precipitate disastrous commentary from his former wife, nee
                    <persName corresp="#ECG">Effie Chalmers Gray</persName> (1828&#x2013;97), now Effie Millais (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RUSKINLATERYEARS">Hilton, <hi rend="italic">John Ruskin: The Later Years</hi></ref>, 171&#x2013;73, 179). 
                    Perhaps, at this crisis, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> found some sort of consolation in

                    perhaps they related to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s marriage to <persName corresp="#ECG">Effie</persName> in that year, which also happened to be the year

                <p>Whatever the secret of his ordering of the Red Books in <date when="1870">1870</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own numbering may have misled him
