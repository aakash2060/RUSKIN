                <p><persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>'s first drawing master from ???? to ???? (see Burd's discussion of this 261). <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName> was employed initially to teach <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>'s cousin,<persName corresp="MRC"> Mary Richardson</persName>. . . .</p>
                <p>In <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#GRAVESDICTIONARY">Graves, <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Artists</hi></ref> (1884), 
                    <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName> is assigned the specialty of a historical painter, and he is credited with 57 exhibitions between <date notBefore="1825" notAfter="1867">1825 and 1867</date>, of which 16 were at the <orgName corresp="ROYALACADEMY"> Royal Academy</orgName>,
                    25 at the  <orgName corresp="BRITISHMUSEUM">British Institution</orgName>, and 16 at the <orgName corresp="SUFFOLKSTREET">Suffolk Street Exhibitions</orgName> (i.e., the Society of British Artists) (p. 203). [check ref works in harris]. Walton 
                    says that <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName> "tried unsuccessfully for years to attract favourable attention as a painter of landscapes, genre scenes, and historical subjects" (9).</p>
                <p><persName corresp="CR">Runciman's</persName> metier was teaching of perspective (RFL 261 n. 13), reflected in <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>'s description of a lesson: "I took my paper &#x0026; I fixed my points, 
                    &#x0026; I drew my perspective, &#x0026; then as Mr <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName> bid me, I began to invent a scene". 
                    Working within this method, <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> constructed a scene by means of what he termed "patch[ing] . . . together": "I examined one of <persName corresp="MRC">Mary</persName>'s pictures, 
                    to see how the rocks were done, &#x0026; then another to see how the woods were done, &#x0026; another to see how the moutains were done, 
                    and another to see how the cottages were done, and I patched them all together, &#x0026; I made such a lovely scene (<persName corresp="JR">John Ruskin</persName> to <persName corresp="JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, <date when="1832-02-20">20 February 1832</date> [RFL 262-63]). 
                    Although <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> expected to be scolded for this patchwork approach to invention, but the master's response was that "patch[ing] up . . . was not copying," 
                    and that "there was something in" <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName>'s picture "that would make him totally change the method he had hitherto pursued with me." Forthwith, <persName corresp="CR"> Runciman</persName> 
                    instructed Ruskin to use watercolor on grey paper, beginning "with a few of the simplest colours, in order to teach me better the effects of light &#x0026; shade." 
                    The aim was "to teach me water colour painting, but . . . only as a basis for oil" (<persName corresp="JR">John Ruskin</persName> to <persName corresp="JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, <date when="1832-02-27">27 February 1832</date> [RFL 267].</p>
                <p>Paul H. Walton speculates this change in approach signifies that <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName> "believed that he had encountered a boy who would one day bring lustre to his teacher's name through his success as a professional 
                    artist in the exhibitions of the <orgName corresp="ROYALACADEMY">Royal Academy</orgName>," but that such ambitions were foiled by the elder <persName corresp="JJR">Ruskins</persName>' plans of a more gentlemanly profession for their son, 
                    for which "advanced training in the techniques and materials of art" such as oils "would introduce an unnecessary and inappropriate degree of specialization" (9. 11). 
                    In due course, as <persName corresp="WALTON"> Walton</persName> points out, <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> came to dislike oil painting, complaining in an <date when="1835">1835</date> rhymed letter to his father of its smell and messiness. Instead, 
                    "<persName corresp="CFARTIST">C. Fielding</persName>s tints alone for me," <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> declared, having begun his lessons with <persName corresp="CFARTIST">Copley Fielding</persName> in this year, the same year in which he appears to have ended 
                    his instruction with <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName> (<persName corresp="JR">John Ruskin</persName> to <persName corresp="JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, <date when="1835-03-11">11 March 1835</date> [RFL 312, and see 261 n 13, 314 n. 3]). If snobbery about an ungentlemanly dirtying 
                    of one's hands was a factor in <persName corresp="JR">Ruski</persName>n's rejection of <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName>'s course of instruction, 
                    so was the time involved in "some fifty coats to be / Splashed on each spot successively" (RFL 312). From the start, however, even when <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> was still 
                    "patching together" his pictures, the quality that perhaps gained <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName>'s attention was a <persName corresp="WW">Wordsworthian</persName> combining of memory and spontaneity. When constructing 
                    his first scene for <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName>, <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> was not entirely copying, because he "thought . . . [his] model resembled" his memory of "the cottage that we saw, 
                    as we went to <placeName corresp="RHAIDYR">Rhaidyr Dhu</placeName>, near <placeName corresp="MAENTWROG">Maentwrog</placeName> where the old woman lived whose grandson went with us to the fall, so very silently" (RFL 262); and the 
                    painting that he had in prospect to learn from <persName corresp="CR">Runciman</persName> seemed to <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> a "superior" art, because he would be able to "carry off <geogName corresp="DERWENTWATER">Derwent Water</geogName> &#x0026; <geogName corresp="SKIDDAW">Skiddaw </geogName>
                    in my pocket" (RFL 268). When graduating to <persName corresp="CFARTIST">Fielding</persName>'s instruction, <persName corresp="JR">Ruskin</persName> was still looking to capture the ephemeral, "To sketch the scenes that pass me by" in 
                    the "lovely world" of "the heavens high" that remind him of other places, such as an illusory "heap of Alpine snow" over the <geogName corresp="NORWOOD">Norwood hill</geogName>s (RFL311, 310_.</p>
