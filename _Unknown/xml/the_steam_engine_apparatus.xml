                    <p>In <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>, the poem is identified only as &#x201C;poem I,&#x201D; the first poem in the 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">MS I Poetry Anthology</title></ref>. Other poems in the 
                        anthology carry a substantive title along with the numbered designation &#x201C;poem II,&#x201D; &#x201C;poem III,&#x201D; and so 
                        on.</p>
                    <p>Between the heading &#x201C;poem I&#x201D; and the text of the poem, however, there is visible the letter <hi rend="italic">o</hi>, followed by an erased 
                        line that is centered on the page like a title&#x2014;&#x201C;The hunt by dar&#x201D; or the last three letters may be 
                        &#x201C;day.&#x201D; If the last three letters are <hi rend="italic">dar</hi>, they probably refer to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s source, a 
                        poem by <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="darwin_erasmus_note.php"><persName corresp="#ED">Erasmus Darwin</persName></ref> 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</ref>). The erased title, if that is what it is, perhaps belonged to the 
                        draft: other partial erasures beneath the text reveal apparently that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> copied a draft or semi&#x2010;final version here, in 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>, 
                        and then erased the draft as he printed the fair copy over top (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Handwriting</ref>).</p>
                    <p>The title &#x201C;The Steam Engine&#x201D; was invented by 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName></ref> for

                        <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> perhaps based his title on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s commentary on the poem

                        override the most straightforward interpretation of <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s having assigned 
                        the date of <date when="1826-01">January 1826</date> specifically to <ref type="apparatus" target="the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php#DATE"><title type="poem" corresp="THENEEDLESSALARM">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;</title></ref> 
                        and thereby singling out that work, possibly, as Ruskin&#x02BC;s first poem.</p>
                    <p>On internal evidence, <title type="poem" corresp="#THESTEAMENGINE">&#x201C;When furious up from mines the water pours&#x201D; [&#x201DC;The Steam Engine&#x201D;]</title> 
                        is more logically placed in <date notBefore="1826-09" notAfter="1826-12">late 1826</date> or 
                        <date notBefore="1827-01" notAfter="1827-04">early 1827</date>, since during that period, according to another annotation by his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> completed the entirety of this <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Book</ref> (see 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php#DATE"><title type="poem" corresp="THENEEDLESSALARM">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;</title>: Date</ref>; 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php#DATE"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title>: Date</ref>). In keeping with this interpretation, 
                        the content of the poem is consistent with the kinds of sources pervading the concluding chapters of 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="HARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</title></ref>, which
                        precedes the anthology. Both the prose lesson and the poem reflect the preoccupations of Enlightenment educationists, 
                        and it is logical that, compositionally, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> maintained the theme of scientific and industrial optimism as he completed the prose lesson 
                        and started the poetry anthology.</p>

                    <p>The Ruskins would have taken pride in the achievement by the Scotsman, <persName corresp="#JW">Watt</persName>

                        indicates that the Ruskins were rooted in the optimism of the British Enlightenment, which <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry and polymathic interests 
                        represented, as well as being steeped in the Romanticism of <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="scott_walter_note.php"><persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName> (1771&#x2013;1832)</ref>.

                        At the same time, as Early Victorians, the Ruskins were able to absorb these influences seemingly safely immune to the political radicalism of this earlier generation.</p>
                    <p>Besides the popularity of <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s works that would have made him known to the Ruskin family 
                        (and his sometimes notoriety for freethinking), <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would have encountered his poetry in quotations by the educational writers 
                        who formed part of <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s large acquaintance and whose books filled <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        boyhood. For example, <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s lines on the steam engine are quoted in Conversation 40, 
                        &#x201C;Of the Steam&#x2010;Engine, and Papin&#x02BC;s Digester&#x201D; in 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SCIENTIFICDIALOGUES">Joyce, <hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></ref>,
                        2:232&#x2013;33), which also provides a summary of the poem. (<persName corresp="#HGV">Helen Gill Viljoen</persName> suggested that 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s source lay solely in <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s summary, 
                        rather than in <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s original poem 
                        [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#VILJOENPAPERS">&#x201C;Helen Gill Viljoen Papers&#x201D;</ref>, box D.V]; 
                        however, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem engages with numerous specific details of diction in <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, 
                        which he could not have derived indirectly through <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>.)</p>
                    <p>The Ruskins might have been interested, too, that <persName corresp="#MB">Boulton</persName>&#x02BC;s coin press, its workings placed at the climax of 
                        <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s description, was operated by four boys of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s age. 
                        As critics have argued, however, the conditions of the laborers who operated such machinery are ignored in <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry, 
                        in which he causes the machines either to be driven by a dainty mythological crew or to seem to run themselves owing to intransitive verbs that allow for no other agency 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#PRIESTMANPOETRYOFDARWIN">Priestman, <hi rend="italic">Poetry of Erasmus Darwin</hi></ref>, 93&#x2013;98). 
                        The operation of <persName corresp="#MB">Boulton</persName>&#x02BC;s coin press is an exception to this obfuscation, in that the four boys are acknowledged in one of <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        characteristically expansive prose notes to the poem; however, <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s purpose in highlighting the boys&#x02BC; industry in 
                        &#x201C;striking thirty thousand guineas in an hour&#x201D; in their <placeName corresp="#SOHO">Soho</placeName> workplace, near <placeName corresp="#BIRMINGHAM">Birmingham</placeName>, 
                        is to award a &#x201C;civic crown&#x201D; to <persName corresp="#MB">Boulton</persName> for having achieved 
                        &#x201C;such superior excellence and cheapness of workmanship, . . . as must totally prevent clandestine imitation, and in consequence save many lives from the hand of the executioner&#x201D;

                        appropriately positioned his poem at the head of the <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">MS I Poetry Anthology</title></ref>,

                        experiments. In fact, in chapters 8&#x2013;9 of <title type="lesson" corresp="#HARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> hurries Harry through a series of experiments in pneumatics drawn from <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>, 
                        stopping just short of Conversation 40 on the steam engine, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> effectively 
                        replaces with his adaptation of <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem on that topic. Thus, in terms both of structure and genre, the contents of 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref> can be viewed as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s extended version of 
                        an Edgeworthian, Joycean, and Barbauldian <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="lesson_note.php">lesson</ref>, 
                        which culminates in an ode to the industrial sublime (see also
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1: Discussion</ref>). In its rhetoric, this
                        structure appears related to <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s tendency in the <title type="lesson" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title> to embellish his prose text 
                        with quotations from <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName> and other poets of the British Enlightenment and scientific revolution.</p>
                    <p>In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s adaptation of <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s lines, 
                        he somewhat reorders the sequence of topics in the original, using less figurative language but also elaborating <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s pictures 
                        in his own way (see the <ref type="gloss_contextual" target="the_steam_engine_glosses.php">glosses</ref> to the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title> witness). 
                        Like <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> begins with the engine draining water from mines to expose the ore. 
                        Next, appearing to have misunderstood <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        figurative account of a bellows that imprisons &#x201C;gales&#x201D; of forceful wind, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> substitutes a literal storm in lines 2&#x2013;3 of his poem, 
                        but in fact he has separated the figurative from its object, recurring to the bellows later in his list of useful applications of steam. 
                        Meanwhile, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intervenes in <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s sequence with steamboats, 
                        which rescue the victims of exploding steamboats&#x2014;an ironic anecdote that seems to bemuse <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, 
                        and that effectively deflates the optimism of <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s futuristic peroration, which predicts the wonders of steam transport. 
                        Three decades on, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> seems to know better than <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName> whose aeronauts beckon from fanciful flying chariots. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> corrects <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s anticipation of a time when steam shall &#x201C;drag the slow barge,&#x201D; 
                        remarking that the &#x201C;smokey barge [is] called by us steam boat.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> admits that steam is &#x201C;the most useful engine brought to man,&#x201D; 
                        and he returns to <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s list of wonders, if only to scramble its order again. 
                        Saving for later <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s pumps that fill cisterns and that pipe water to &#x201C;thirsty cities,&#x201D; 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> presses on to <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s steam&#x2010;powered millstones, 
                        which enchant him for <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s rhyme of <hi rend="italic">whirl</hi> and <hi rend="italic">twirl</hi> 
                        (thrice repeated by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>). He has no use 
                        for <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s pitch for grain&#x2010;based vegetarianism, preferring to keep up the &#x201C;twirling&#x201D; 
                        by introducing instead <persName corresp="#SRA">Arkwright</persName>&#x02BC;s cotton spinning machine. 
                        The action of revolving seems to take over <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, as he continues with <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName> 
                        to describe the round coins minted by <persName corresp="#MB">Boulton</persName>&#x02BC;s machine 
                        (here he is taken by another of <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s rhymes, <hi rend="italic">squeeze</hi> and <hi rend="italic">seize</hi>); 
                        and he comes back to <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s water pumped to thirsty cities in order to 
                        send the water &#x201C;round the town&#x201D; and back again. Finally, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> clenches these revolutions 
                        with an original contribution&#x2014;the picture of a chain that an engine has forged &#x201C;link to link&#x201D; and impressed with a floral design like a bracelet.</p>
                    <p>Formally, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> borrows <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s heroic couplets without the pomposity of what 
                        <persName corresp="#WW">Wordsworth</persName> condemns in the preface to <title type="anthology" corresp="#LYRICALBALLADS"><hi rend="italic">Lyrical Ballads</hi></title> 
                        as the artifice of poetic diction. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> catches <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s livelier rhyme words, 
                        and the poet&#x02BC;s energy and exuberance. Of course, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may simply have avoided a learnedness of diction that he did not understand 
                        at his young age; he shows a similar preference for poetic over pedantic terms in his
                        adaptation of <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SCIENTIFICDIALOGUES">Joyce, <hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></ref>,
                        in <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</ref>. But <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                        liked unusual words that could energize his writing; and perhaps the appeal for him of <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry lay 
                        in the extraordinary fertility with which the poet invented words&#x2014;a major factor in the success of 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="BOTANICGARDEN"><hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden</hi></title>, as suggested by <persName corresp="#DGK">D. G. King&#x2010;Hele</persName>

                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may even have appreciated <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName> for a quality that, in the poet&#x02BC;s own time, was a target 
                        for criticism&#x2014;his tendency to make &#x201C;every word picturesque,&#x201D; as <persName corresp="#RS">Robert Southey</persName> characterized his diction, 
                        or &#x201C;a succession of Landscapes or Paintings,&#x201D; as <persName corresp="#STC">S. T. Coleridge</persName> noted,
