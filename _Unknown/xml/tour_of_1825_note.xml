                <head type="title">Tour of 1825</head>
                <p>In <date when="1825-05">May 1825</date>, the Ruskin family made its first visit to the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName>, 
                    a tour that was limited to <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName> Field, <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName>, 
                    and <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName> (including <placeName corresp="#VERSAILLES">Versailles</placeName>). As such, the journey was characteristically post&#x2010;Napoleonic. 
                    In his <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFMS33A">Diary, 1833&#x2013;46</ref>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> reflects back on this <date when="1825">1825</date> journey, 
                    comparing their experiences during the much more ambitious Continental <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1833_note.html">Tour of <date when="1833">1833</date></ref>. 
                    He notes that <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName> on their present visit was &#x201C;not so gay as in <date when="1825-05">May 1825</date>&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#RFMS33A">Diary of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>,<date notBefore="1833" notAfter="1846">1833&#x2013;46</date></ref>, 72, 73).
                </p>
                <p>The journey may seem ambitious for a middle&#x2010;class <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> family, only recently established in their suburban home, and with a young boy; 
                    however, <geogName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</geogName> crossings limited to the nearby and comparatively inexpensive destination of <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName> were common in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, 
                    and trips expressly to view the <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName> battlefield
                    had been popular since as early as the weeks following the battle itself. The popularity had been enhanced by personal visits paid by such well&#x2010;known literary figures as 
                    <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>, <persName corresp="#RS">Robert Southey</persName>, and <persName corresp="#GGB">Lord Byron</persName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#FRANCOIS1815">Fran&#x00E7;ois, &#x201C;If It&#x02BC;s 1815, This Must Be <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>&#x201D;</ref>, 74&#x2013;75, 89). 
                    The year of the Ruskins&#x02BC; crossing is noted as a watershed for middle&#x2010;class British travel by historians studying the opening of <placeName corresp="#NETHERLANDS">Netherlands</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>, and northern <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>, 
                    more rapid crossings having been made possible by the rise of steam packet lines. The steam lines greatly increased the efficiency, reliability, and carrying capacity 
                    for travelers who could take holidays from employment 
                    only for definite periods and on a limited budget. 
                    Presumably, the traveling party included <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s nurse, 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="strachan_anne_note.html"><persName corresp="#ASB">Anne Strachan</persName></ref>, who later accompanied the family also on the <date when="1833">1833</date> journey.</p>
                <p>By the <date notBefore="1825" notAfter="1829">mid&#x2010;1820s</date>, steam packets accommodated large excursion parties along with individual travelers, 
                    and the amenities included food and drink and even entertainment, with music performance being common onboard
