                <p>While the Ruskins had crossed the <placeName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</placeName> for the modest <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1825_note.php">Tour of 1825</ref> 
                    to view <placeName corresp="#WATERLOO">Waterloo</placeName> battlefield, <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName>, 
                    their first ambitious tour of the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> occurred <date notBefore="1833-05-10" notAfter="1833-09-22">between May and September 1833</date>. 
                    The tour therefore fell only a few years after the <date notBefore="1830-07-26" notAfter="1830-07-29">July Revolution</date> in <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName> 
                    and the <date notBefore="1830-08-25" notAfter="1831-07-14">Belgian Revolution of 1830</date>.
                </p>
                <p>The Ruskin traveling party included, besides <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> and his parents, 
                    his cousin, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_mary_note.php"><persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName></ref>, 
                    and his nurse, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="strachan_ann_note.php"><persName corresp="#ASB">Anne Strachan</persName></ref>. 
                    On the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName>, they enjoyed the services of a cicerone, named <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="salvador_note.php">Salvador</ref>; 
                    and in <date when="1833">1833</date>, as in <date when="1825">1825</date>, the family benefited from the rapid rise of efficent and inexpensive travel to the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> by steam. 
                    For these developments in travel across the <placeName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">English Channel</placeName>, which the Ruskins enjoyed 
                    along with thousands of middle&#x2010;class <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">British</placeName> travelers in the decades after the <date when="1815-06-18">Battle of Waterloo</date>, 
                    see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1825_note.php">Tour of 1825</ref>. 
                    In <date when="1833">1833</date>, steam packets departed daily between <date notBefore="1833-04" notAfter="1833-11">April and November</date> for <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName> 
                    from the <placeName corresp="#TOWEROFLONDON">Tower of London</placeName>, and five days per week from <placeName corresp="#DOVER">Dover</placeName>, 
                    which was where the Ruskins boarded. Traveling to <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName> in the same year as the Ruskins, 
                    <persName corresp="#FMT">Frances Trollope</persName> (<date notBefore="1769" notAfter="1863">1779&#x2013;1863</date>) found that her steam vessel was &#x201C;dirty, and the fare both bad and insufficient,&#x201D; 
                    especially for the &#x201C;many children aboard&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#TROLLOPEBELGIUM">Trollope, <title type="guidebook" corresp="#TROLLOPEBELGIUM" rend="italic">Belgium and Western Germany in 1833</title></ref>, 1:2) 
                    In contrast, <persName corresp="#MRC">Mary Richardson</persName>, proud that the Ruskin family &#x201C;went by English packet (not French),&#x201D; 
                    commented that there were &#x201C;not many passengers but all kept well&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFT48">Diary of Mary Richardson, 1833</ref>, p. 1).
                </p>
                <p>Besides relying on their courier, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="salvador_note.php">Salvador</ref>, the Ruskins carried guidebooks, 
                    which in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1835">1820s through the mid&#x2010;1830s</date> were undergoing a transition. 
                    The vade mecum for <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">English</placeName> travelers landing in <placeName corresp="#NORMANDY">Normandy</placeName> 
                    and the Low Countries, <persName corresp="#JM">John Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836"><title type="guidebook" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836" rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book for Travellers on the Continent</title></ref>, 
                    did not become available until <date when="1836">1836</date>. Whereas <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    <title type="guidebook" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836" rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book</title> is now often credited with founding the genre of the modern <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">English</placeName> traveler&#x02BC;s guidebook, 
                    for earlier journeys like the Ruskins&#x02BC;, taken after the reopening of the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> following the <date when="1815-06-18">Battle of Waterloo</date> in  
                    <date notBefore="1815" notAfter="1836">1815 and continuing through the mid&#x2010;1830s</date>, travelers relied on publications that combined personal travel narrative with some practical advice. 
                    As <persName corresp="#PF">Pieter Fran&#x00E7;ois</persName> has shown, in the period prior to the publication of <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="guidebook" corresp="#MURRAYSHANDBOOKCONTINENT1836" rend="italic">Hand&#x2010;book</title>, 
                    there appeared numerous examples of the guidebook genre, particularly relating to the Low Countries, but in an emergent and somewhat inchoate form. 
                    Only gradually, after <date when="1815-06-18">Waterloo</date>, the modern guidebook emerged as a genre distinct from the so&#x2010;called 
                    <hi rend="italic">travel account</hi>, in that the guidebook came to offer mainly practical travel advice, 
                    whereas the more traditional travel account emphasized topographical description and narrative from an individual perspective 
                    (albeit not too individualistic, lest decorum and authority seem to succumb to eccentricity). In the immediate <date notBefore="1815-06-18">post&#x2010;Waterloo</date> period, 
                    these genres were often mixed in the same book, with traces of the eighteenth&#x2010;century travel account governing the narrative (for example, in the adoption of an epistolary form), 
                    while tables of practical advice were added to recommend the book in a crowded field 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRANCOIS1815">Fran&#x00E7;ois, <title type="article" corresp="#FRANCOIS1815">&#x201C;If It&#x02BC;s 1815, This Must Be Belgium&#x201D;</title></ref>, 76&#x2013;82).
                </p>
                <p>This transitional and eclectic period of travel writing is reflected in the Ruskins&#x02BC; book purchases, 
                    both before setting out on their <date when="1833">1833</date> journey and following their return. Besides arming themselves with a <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">German</placeName> grammar book, 
                    the Ruskins carried a work by <persName corresp="#MSA">Mariana Starke</persName> (<date notBefore="1762" notAfter="1838">1762&#x2013;1838</date>), 
                    whose travel books both <persName corresp="#PF">Fran&#x00E7;ois</persName> and <persName corresp="#JB">James Buzard</persName> characterize as typical of the transitional period 
                    of travel writing, displaying characteristics both of the guidebook and the travel account, 
                    and whose work <persName corresp="#CB">Charles Batten</persName> similarly describes as moving away from the decorum of the eighteenth&#x2010;century travel account 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRANCOIS1815">Fran&#x00E7;ois, <title type="article" corresp="#FRANCOIS1815">&#x201C;If It&#x02BC;s 1815, This Must Be Belgium&#x201D;</title></ref>, 76, 90;

                    The <persName corresp="#MSA">Starke</persName> work acquired by the Ruskins may have been <title type="guidebook" corresp="#STARKETRAVELS" rend="italic">Travels in Europe</title>, a popular guidebook first published by 
                    <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">Murray</orgName> in <date when="1820">1820</date> as <title type="guidebook" corresp="#MURRAYTRAVELLERS1820" rend="italic">Travellers on the Continent</title>, 
                    and available in a &#x201C;considerably enlarged&#x201D; eighth edition in <date when="1833">1833</date>.

                <p><persName corresp="#MSA">Starke&#x02BC;s</persName> <title type="guidebook" corresp="#STARKETRAVELS" rend="italic">Travels in Europe</title> along with her more portable <title type="guidebook" corresp="#STARKEDIRECTIONS" rend="italic">Information and Directions for Travellers on the Continent</title>, 
                    which was published on the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName> by Galignani, approached closely, <persName corresp="#JB">Buzard</persName> remarks, 
                    to the form of the modern guidebook. Even <persName corresp="#MSA">Starke</persName>&#x02BC;s much earlier success, <title type="guidebook" corresp="#STARKEITALY" rend="italic">Travels in Italy</title> 
                    (<date when="1800">1800</date>), had been &#x201C;felt by many before the rise of the <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">Murray</orgName> 
                    and <orgName corresp="#BAEDEKER">Baedeker</orgName> guides to be the best available vade&#x2010;mecum for <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>.&#x201D; 
                    This work, <persName corresp="#JB">Buzard</persName> says, &#x201C;was by no means single&#x2010;mindedly devoted to the role of &#x2018;handbook.&#x2019;&#x201D; 
                    It was characteristic of the transitional period of travel writing, in having &#x201C;the appearance, 
                    when we look back at it with generic presuppositions founded on <orgName corresp="#MURRAY">Murray</orgName> and <orgName corresp="#BAEDEKER">Baedeker</orgName>, 
                    of an impressionistic &#x2018;travel book&#x2019;&#x201D;&#x2014;that is, as still relying, despite its &#x201C;serving as a makeshift [modern] &#x2018;handbook&#x2019; 
                    in the absence of any alternative,&#x201D; on such eighteenth&#x2010;century conventions as a series of letters containing the traveler&#x02BC;s personal impressions 
                    balanced by judicious reflection (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BUZARDBEATEN">Buzard, <title type="book" corresp="#BUZARDBEATEN" rend="italic">Beaten Track</title></ref>, 68, and see 69&#x2013;70).
                </p>
                <p>Comparatively compendious as <title type="guidebook" corresp="#STARKETRAVELS" rend="italic">Travels in Europe</title> was, the guide offered no advice on the route from 
                    <placeName corresp="#CALAIS">Calais</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#COLOGNE">Cologne</placeName>, which the Ruskins followed in order to access the 
                    <placeName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine</placeName>; for while <persName corresp="#MSA">Starke</persName>&#x02BC;s updated guide did supply information on 
                    <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName> and many other regions of Europe in an appendix, the main text remained traditionally focused on getting the traveler 
                    first to <placeName corresp="#PARIS">Paris</placeName>, and then to <placeName corresp="#ITALY">Italy</placeName>. Once arrived in the South, however, 
                    the Ruskins would have found <persName corresp="#MSA">Starke</persName>&#x02BC;s work handy for its more modern, guidebook&#x2010;like feature

                        <persName corresp="#JM">Murray</persName>&#x02BC;s guidebook calculates, the journey to <placeName corresp="#BRUSSELS">Brussels</placeName> by diligence would have required about twenty&#x2010;four hours

                        through the heart of the newly formed nation of <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>, the Ruskins observed a region that had suffered a long history of contestation beteen nations, 
                        but that was now catching up with modern industrialization. <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain&#x02BC;s</placeName> superiority in industrial development, as compared with that in <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>, 
                        remained an article of faith on both sides of the <geogName corresp="#ENGLISHCHANNEL">Channel</geogName>; however, British perception of <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName> was undergoing a transformation, 
                        with Tory suspicions of the <geogName corresp="#CONTINENT">Continent</geogName>&#x02BC;s revolutions subsiding in favor of a whiggish view of <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName> as a &#x201C;little Britain&#x201D; of industrial prosperity, 
                        constitutionalism, rationalism, and even (the British persuaded themselves) an ersatz Protestantism 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#STEARNSBRITISHINDUSTRY">Stearns, <title type="article" corresp="#STEARNSBRITISHINDUSTRY">&#x201C;British Industry through the Eyes of French Industrialists&#x201D;</title></ref>; and

                        <persName corresp="#FMT">Mrs. Trollope</persName> urged the &#x201C;whole of the British nation&#x201D; to &#x201C;feel a deep and affectionate interest for the amiable prince [<persName corresp="#LGCF">Leopold I</persName>, <date notBefore="1790" notAfter="1865">1790&#x2013;1865</date>] 
                        who has been induced to accept the throne of <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>. It is impossible to forget how near he has been to <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>,&#x201D; she effused, 
                        referring to his marriage to the late Princess Charlotte (<date notBefore="1796" notAfter="1817">1796&#x2013;1817</date>), which had once put him in line to become prince consort to a successor of the English throne. 
                        Still, <persName corresp="#FMT">Mrs. Trollope</persName> considered <persName corresp="#LGCF">Leopold</persName>&#x02BC;s position to be false, since the citizens of the new Belgian nation remained &#x201C;unresistingly shackled&#x201D; 
                        by their Catholic culture on the one hand, while &#x201C;a club or a dagger [was] put by law into the[ir] other&#x201D; hand by the new constitution: 
                        &#x201C;Nothing can present a stranger anomaly in human affairs than the sight of a nation, deeply and severely Catholic, 
                        attempting to ape the chartered libertinism of political thinking, which a few noisy and discontented persons are endeavouring to teach them. 
                        The law which authorizes unrestrained license of tongue and pen, both public and private, on all subjects, whether political or religious, 
                        accords ill with the principles of a people whose religion commands them to bring their thoughts, words, and deeds before the tribunal of their priests&#x201D;

                    <p>That the Ruskins agreed with these ambivalent views is evident in the flashes of anti&#x2010;Catholicism and comments on the mercantile inferiority of the region

                        &#x201C;Amongst our poor weavers there is everything to depress to degrade to debauch &#x0026; brutalize,&#x201D;

                        To traverse the region, the Ruskins would have received only limited help from the recently updated guidebook by <persName corresp="#MSA">Mariana Starke</persName>
