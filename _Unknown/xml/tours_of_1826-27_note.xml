                <p>According to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</ref>, 
                    the family holidayed in <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName>, a journey from <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#SUSSEX">Sussex</placeName>
                    that presumably took place in <date when="1826">1826</date> prior to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s composing his &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;
                    narrative, although it is possible that the story refers to a previous season. Seaside resorts attracted the Ruskins 
                    from nearly <date when="1818">the start of their marriage</date>, probably for their salubriousness to health as well as for pleasure 
                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="seaside_resorts_note.php"><placeName corresp="#SEASIDE">Seaside Resorts</placeName></ref>, and see also

                <p>The destinations of the <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> family tours of <date when="1826">1826</date> and <date when="1827">1827</date> were established by
                    <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> in <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="poems_1891_note.php"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1891)</ref>; 
                    and while the dates of those tours were revised, and the destinations refined, by subsequent editors and biographers, the broad assumptions have not been
                    challenged. Those assumptions rest, however, on possibly confusing evidence in the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref>, 
                    and it may be that evidence referring apparently to two separate northern journeys, of <date when="1826">1826</date> and of <date when="1827">1827</date>, in fact refer
                    to a single tour of <date when="1827">1827</date>.</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> took as his first point of reference the poems <ref type="apparatus" target="on_scotland_apparatus.php">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</ref>
                    and <ref type="apparatus" target="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;)</ref>. 
                    The former, he declared, &#x201C;record[s <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s] impressions received during a journey from
                    <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> with his parents, after visiting his <persName corresp="#JRP">aunt</persName> at <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>&#x201D;
                    in <date when="1826">1826</date>. Specifically, he believed, the poem captured the return journey, given the poem&#x02BC;s trope of changes: one
                    line &#x201C;is no doubt a reminiscence of the <date when="1826-05">May</date> sunshine in which they went northwards; for their start was usually made about the middle of May; and
                    [<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>] contrasts the sunny anticipation of the arrival with the autumnal gloom of the departure&#x201D;
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>,
                    1:xxii&#x2013;xxiii; <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS8D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [8<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1:ix). On the
                    strength of this interpretation, <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> renamed this poem &#x201C;Farewell
                    to Scotland&#x201D; (see <ref type="apparatus" target="on_scotland_apparatus.php#TITLE">&#x201C;To Scotland&#x201D;: Title</ref>).</p>
                <p>The latter portion of this interpretation, at the very least, has been disproved by <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName>, who points out
                    that, in <date when="1826-05">May 1826</date>, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> was on the road
                    beyond his <date when="1826-05-10">10 May</date> birthday, as attested by his dated letters to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> extending through the end of the month.
                    Business had been lean that year, thus delaying a family holiday (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>,
                    137, 139 n. 1, 150 n. 5, 137).</p>
                <p>Moreover, further upsetting the family&#x02BC;s routine, in <date notBefore="1826-04" notAfter="1826-05">April and May</date> they
                    coped with the consumptive decline and death of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> cousin,
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_james_note.php"><persName corresp="#JRPSON">James Richardson</persName></ref>, who had been living at
                    <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="herne_hill_note.php"><placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName></ref> while working at
                    <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="ruskin_telford_note.php"><orgName corresp="#RUSKINETAL">Ruskin, Telford, and Domecq</orgName></ref>. 
                    By <date when="1826-04">April</date>, <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>&#x02BC;s health had declined so alarmingly that he returned to his family in 
                    <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>, possibly escorted on this journey by <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> and <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>. 
                    The youth died soon after his return, on <date when="1826-05-08">8 May</date>, a few days before <date when="1826-05-10"><persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s birthday</date>. 
                    When <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> learned of his nephew&#x02BC;s death, he was traveling in the northwest, and he did not return home until 
                    <date notBefore="1826-05-25" notAfter="1826-05-31">the end of May</date> at the earliest 
                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 139 n. 1, 149; see also 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_james_note.php"><persName corresp="#JRPSON">James Richardson [1808&#x2013;26]</persName></ref>).</p>
                <p><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> states that &#x201C;in <date when="1826-04">April</date> the Ruskins took . . . <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName> 
                    back to <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>,&#x201D; an inference that he presumably takes from <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    letter of <date notBefore="1826-05-07" notAfter="1826-05-08">7&#x2013;8 May</date>, in which she reflects on <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                    &#x201C;journey up.&#x201D; <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> is reminding her husband that, on this journey, 
                    <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName> &#x201C;had none of that spirit which youths of his age usually have,&#x201D; so that 
                    &#x201C;both you &#x0026; I had repeatedly asked him if he was quite sure he was happy and . . . he had assured us in the strongest terms he was.&#x201D; 
                    <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s references are somewhat obscure; however, assuming that the elder Ruskins did make this journey 
                    to <placeName corresp="PERTH">Perth</placeName> along with <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>, would they have allowed <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> 
                    to come along? Considering that <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> admonished the boy&#x02BC;s mother, <persName corresp="#JRP">Jessie Richardson</persName>, 
                    &#x201C;that the children should not be much with . . . [<persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>] for fear
                    of infection&#x201D; (referring to his brothers and sisters), it seems unlikely that <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> would have risked exposing 
                    her own son. It seems equally unlikely that she would have wanted her son to remain close at hand where he might witness <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>&#x02BC;s death, 
                    since she felt &#x201C;next to convinced that worlds could not save him.&#x201D; She observed this &#x201C;when <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>
                    was at <placeName corresp="#CROYDON">Croydon</placeName>,&#x201D; doubtless referring to the house of her sister, <persName corresp="#BR">Bridget Richardson</persName>. 
                    Thus, perhaps <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName> was left with his <placeName corresp="#CROYDON">Croydon</placeName> aunt, uncle, and cousins, while his parents 
                    carried <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName> to <placeName corresp="PERTH">Perth</placeName> 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 134 n. 3, 142).</p>
                <p>Did <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s fears prevent the family from journeying north in <date when="1826">1826</date> altogether, even later in the year? 
                    While <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> corrects <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s assumption that the Scottish journey occurred in <date when="1826-05">May</date>,
                    he relies on the same evidence as does <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> to affirm that &#x201C;the family probably went in <date when="1826-09">September&#x201D; 1826</date> 
                    to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 150 n. 5).
                    Both conclusions go back to the evidence of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, <ref type="apparatus" target="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;)</ref>, 
                    and to <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s belief that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote it, like <ref type="apparatus" target="on_scotland_apparatus.php">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</ref>, either 
                    &#x201C;during the journey home&#x201D; from a <date notBefore="1826-03-20" notAfter="1826-06-21">spring</date> tour to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> (which
                    certainly did not occur), &#x201C;or on his return [to <placeName corresp="LONDON">London</placeName>], in <date when="1826-09">September</date>&#x201D; 
                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS4D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1:xxiii;
                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POEMS8D1891"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> [8<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, 1891]</ref>, 1:x).</p>
                <p>The <date when="1826-09">September</date> date comes originally, as <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> remarks, from an annotation by <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName> in <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php">MS III</ref> attributing
                    &#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;) to that month (<persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, like <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, attributes the gloss to
                    <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>, but the hand is <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s). It is
                    possible that a <date when="1826-09">September</date> journey resulted not only in this poem but also in the entirety of <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php">MS I</ref> 
                    (including the <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php">MS I Poetry Anthology</ref>,
                    which contains &#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;), since <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> noted her <persName corresp="#JR">son</persName> as having started 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php">MS I</ref> at about that time, in <date notBefore="1826-09" notAfter="1826-10">September or October 1826</date> 
                    (see <ref type="apparatus" target="the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php#DATE">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;: Date</ref>; and <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php#DATE">MS I: Date</ref>). The 
                    available evidence does fit together tidily enough.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, the circumstantial evidence, which can be read as supporting the traditional case, can also be read as supporting <hi rend="italic">only</hi>
                    a northern tour of <date when="1827">1827</date>, and not tours of both <date when="1826">1826</date> <hi rend="italic">and</hi> <date when="1827">1827</date>. The problem is
                    that the only evidence of a northern journey contained in <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php">MS I</ref> (the manuscript dated by <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> 
                    as <date notBefore="1826-09" notAfter="1827-01">September or October 1826 through January 1827</date>) 
                    is &#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;&#x2014;and that poem might be interpreted as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s elegy on
                    his cousin, <persName corresp="#JRPSON">James</persName>, rather than as a topographical poem based on eyewitness
                    travel. The contents of <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php">MS I</ref> are principally taken up by <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</ref>, 
                    and that tale is set entirely at <placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> except for a holiday at <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName>. That the family actually sought such a

                <p>A <date notBefore="1826-06-21" notAfter="1826-09-22">summer</date> holiday on the coast would not have precluded a <date notBefore="1826-09-22" notAfter="1826-12-21">fall</date> journey
                    northward; and <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s trope of &#x201C;change&#x201D; in &#x201C;On Scotland,&#x201D; could have been suggested by a number of disorientations

                <p>Still, there is no question that the Scottish connections are strongest in <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php">MS III</ref>, belonging to <date when="1827">1827</date>.

                    Both poems, albeit in separate anthologies in <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php">MS III</ref>, could date from <date notBefore="1827-09" notAfter="1827-12">late 1827</date> (see

                    <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s dating of that poem as <date when="1826-09">September 1826</date> that lends credence to a
                    journey to that region in that year.</p>
                <p>In the introduction to <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#TOURLAKES"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> and <persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, eds., <hi rend="italic">Tour of the Lakes</hi></ref>,
                    <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> rehearses the same set of poems not only as evidence for an <date when="1826">1826</date> <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> journey, but also 
                    a visit to the <geogName corresp="#LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</geogName> annexed to the same trip (&#x201C;by way of <placeName corresp="#CONISTON">Coniston</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#KESWICK">Keswick</placeName>&#x201D;)

                    That poem, however, as <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> himself points out, was misdated as <date when="1828">1828</date> by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s earlier editors, belonging in fact to
                    <date when="1829">1829</date>. The poem proves nothing, therefore, about the case for an <date when="1826">1826</date> northern tour;
                    nor does the remark <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName> quotes by <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> in a <date when="1827-02-21">21 February 1827</date> letter to
                    <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>, referring to &#x201C;our delightful Journey together,&#x201D; which may
                    refer&#x2014;not to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> and the <geogName corresp="#LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</geogName>, as <persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>
                    assumes&#x2014;but merely to the <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName> visit indicated in &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1 
                    (although the remark does seem to refer to a journey taken in the previous year, <date when="1826">1826</date>; 
                    see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 152; and

                <p>All of this is to say that some skepticism is warranted about the dates and destinations of the Ruskin family&#x02BC;s earlier tours, evidence for which has, 
                    for more than a century, turned on the dating of a few poems. Ultimately, the case hinges on <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s gloss of 
                    <ref type="apparatus" target="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;)</ref> 
                    as <date when="1826-09">September 1826</date>, and we cannot know precisely what she intended by that date. We also lack firm evidence about the itinerary: 
                    if <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s remark to his <persName corresp="#MR">wife</persName> about &#x201C;our delightful Journey together&#x201D; 
                    does refer to a northern journey in <date when="1826-09">September 1826</date>&#x2014;and, writing in <date when="1827-02">February 1827</date>,
                    he does seem to imply a recent journey&#x2014;on what evidence do we conclude that this journey included the <geogName corresp="#LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</geogName>?</p>

                    it seems likely that she traveled with the family in order to return home to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>

                        indicating that the itinerary was already planned.</p>
                   <p>According to the prose account of the journey in <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#HARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2</title></ref>, 
                        the itinerary took the Ruskins first to <placeName corresp="#SALTHILL">Salt Hill</placeName>, a major stage west of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, opening to the <placeName corresp="#GWR">Great West Road</placeName>; 
                       however, rather than heading west toward <placeName corresp="#BRISTOL">Bristol</placeName>, 
                        the Ruskins turned northwest to <placeName corresp="#OXFORD">Oxford</placeName>, 
                        where they stayed briefly to view the colleges. They proceeded through <placeName corresp="#GLOUCESTER">Gloucester</placeName>, presumably on a straight path to <placeName corresp="#ROSSONWYE">Ross&#x2010;on&#x2010;Wye</placeName>, 
                        an established launching place for a tour of the <geogName corresp="#WYE">Wye Valley</geogName>, but 
                        Ruskin&#x02BC;s account next mentions <placeName corresp="#MONMOUTH">Monmouth</placeName>. It is not clear, therefore, whether the prose account accurately describes the sequence of the itinerary. 
                        Ruskin describes <placeName corresp="#TINTERN">Tintern Abbey</placeName> at length, followed by a reference to <placeName corresp="#WINDCLIFF">Windcliff</placeName>&#x2013;one of the eminences surrounding the dramatic bend in the river that 
                        encloses the peninsula of <placeName corresp="#LANCAUT">Lancaut</placeName>&#x2013;but the narrative neglects to mention <placeName corresp="#RAGLAN">Raglan Castle</placeName>, which figures prominently as the subject of Ruskin&#x02BC;s poem 
                       in <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">Poetry Discriptive</title></ref>. 
                        Thus, it seems likely that the travel narrative and poetry anthology are governed less by concerns for accuracy, like a memoir, 
                        than by the high points of picturesque viewing (indeed, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D; purports to be a fictionalized lesson in the manner the Edgeworths&#x02BC; series of lessons, 
                        and not autobiographical; see <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION">MS III: Discussion</ref>). 
                       <placeName corresp="#WINDCLIFF">Windcliff</placeName>, for example, was known primarily as a picturesque spot&#x2013;one 
                        of the elevated views over the river from the Piercefield estate, 
                        famous for its picturesque walks developed during the age of <persName corresp="#CAPABILITY">Capability Brown</persName> (<date notBefore="1716" notAfter="1783">1716&#x2013;83</date>)

                    <p>Wearied with another challenging year for his business, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> perhaps welcomed an excursion through the 
                        <geogName corresp="#WYE">Wye Valley</geogName> which offered provisions for easy travel 
                        that had been honed to commercial efficiency by three&#x2010;quarters of a century of popular picturesque viewing. 
                        From the <date notBefore="1760" notAfter="1800">1760s through the turn of the century</date>, the preferred modes for experiencing the dramatic features 
                        along the craggy banks of the river were by water or by foot 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ANDREWSPICTURESQUE">Andrews, <hi rend="italic">Search for the Picturesque</hi>, 84&#x2013;107</ref>). 
                        By the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, however, the Ruskins would have benefitted from easier carriage access 
                        owing to road improvements, including a new turnpike from <placeName corresp="#CHEPSTOW">Chepstow</placeName> and a carriageway from <placeName corresp="#MONMOUTH">Monmouth</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#RAGLAN">Raglan Castle</placeName>; 
                        and in the year of their journey, the Ruskins could have observed an industrial&#x2010;age iron bridge under construction at <placeName corresp="#BIGSWEIR">Bigsweir</placeName>, 
                        midway between <placeName corresp="#TINTERN">Tintern</placeName> and <placeName corresp="#MONMOUTH">Monmouth</placeName>. If they left their carriage for a water excursion, 
                        they could have embarked on one of the steam packets that had been operating throughout the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>

                    <p>Insofar as the sequence of landmarks in <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2</ref>, can be trusted, 
                        the family took the length of the <geogName corresp="#WYE">Wye Valley</geogName> excursion at least from <placeName corresp="#MONMOUTH">Monmouth</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#TINTERN">Tintern Abbey</placeName> 
                        (the tour normally departing from <placeName corresp="ROSSONWYE">Ross&#x2010;on&#x2010;Wye</placeName> and ending at <placeName corresp="#CHEPSTOW">Chepstow</placeName>). 
                        At <placeName corresp="#MONMOUTH">Monmouth</placeName>, a short ride would have brought the visitors to <placeName rend="italic" corresp="#RAGLAN">Raglan Castle</placeName>, 
                        prompting <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <ref type="apparatus" target="ragland_castle_apparatus.php">poem of that name</ref>.

                        showing open water crowded with both large ships under full sail and smoking steamboats, so it appears likely that the Ruskins continued

                        Not only were these guidebooks popular and widely available, but there is also evidence of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s close attention to <persName corresp="#CHMONMOUTH">Heath</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                        approach to interpreting the castle and abbey ruins. A drawing in 
                        <ref type="appendix" target="msiii_appendix.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref> is entitled 
                        <ref type="drawing" target="ragland_castle_drawing_msiii.php">&#x201C;Ragland Castle When Newly Built&#x201D;</ref>, an idea that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                        may have borrowed from <title type="guidebook" rend="italic" corresp="#HEATHRAGLANDCASTLE">Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of Ragland Castle</title>, 
                        in which <persName corresp="#CHMONMOUTH">Heath</persName> organizes information under the two heads, 
                        &#x201C;The Castle in Its Present State, as It Is Now Shewn&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Castle in Its Splendor&#x201D;&#x2014;the latter 
                        reconstructing the castle&#x02BC;s past state, &#x201C;when newly built,&#x201D; as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> puts it.

           <p>The travel narrative in <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2</ref>, next jumps to <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName>, 
               without explaining how the Ruskins traveled there from <placeName corresp="#WALES">Wales</placeName>&#x2014;except, &#x201C;<name type="fictional">Harry</name>&#x201D; says, that they went by sea on a steamboat. 
               Unless the sea voyage is entirely fanciful, this crossing or coastal sailing 
                        presumably occurred on the eastern side of <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> omitting an account of the northeastern journey from <placeName corresp="#WALES">Wales</placeName>. 
               This leg of the tour would have presented an opportunity 
                        to visit some portion of the <geogName corresp="#LAKEDISTRICT">Lake District</geogName> before heading east to the opposite coast.</p>
                    <p>Places mentioned in <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> are <placeName corresp="#KINROSS">Kinross</placeName>, 
                        <placeName corresp="#LOCHLEVEN">Lochleven</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>. Returning south, the Ruskins crossed at 
                        <placeName corresp="#QUEENSFERRY">Queensferry</placeName> for <placeName corresp="#EDINBURGH">Edinburgh</placeName>; 
                        and they continued south along the <placeName corresp="#GNR">Great North Road</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#HADDINGTON">Haddington</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#BERWICK">Berwick&#x2010;upon&#x2010;Tweed</placeName>, 
                        <placeName corresp="#ALNWICK">Alnwick</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#NEWCASTLE">Newcastle upon Tyne</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#DURHAM">Durham</placeName>,

                        and <placeName corresp="#DONCASTER">Doncaster</placeName>. There the narrative is sliced off, with the promise: &#x201C;But I will put them on to <placeName corresp="#SCARTHINGMOOR">scarthing moor</placeName> [near Newark&#x2010;on&#x2010;Trent] in another chapter&#x201D;.</p>
